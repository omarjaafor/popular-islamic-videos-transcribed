      "May Allah SWT give us His blessings in this month, accept our fasts, our devotion and prayers and keep us on the right path. I'm going to talk to you about few verses from the first Juz of the Holy Quran. And these verses are from the last part of this Juz. Ayat 126-129",
      "Allah mentions that how the building of Kaaba was done. Ibrahim and his son both of them built the Kaaba, and Allah says that before that, before the building, they chose a place and that place is known as Makkah so it was not a city at that time",
      "at that time, Ibrahim prayed to Allah for the city. So he prayed to Allaah. O Allah make this a safe city, a secure city. It should be an important concern that the place where we are going to have is this great center it should be safe and secure place. And also pray for the people",
      "and provide the people of this area the fruits that means the sustenance so for their economic well-being. And Ibrahim said Provide fruits and sustenances for those who believe in Allah in the last day because Ibrahim was a believer",
      "So as a believer he said, provide fruit to those who believe in Allah and the last day. But Allah SWT corrected him immediately and He said, As far as the fruits are concerned, the worldly things are concerned I will give it to believers and non-believers. Even those who deny and disbelieve, I will",
      "But then they will come back to Allah. And then Allah will judge them. Then they will be punished. And that will be a terrible place, the hellfire. So Ibrahim was corrected and then after that Ibrahim and his son Ismail both of them started raising the building.",
      "Allah says, And remember that Ibrahim and Ismail both of them raising the foundations of the house. And that is the house of God, Allah, the Kaaba. So first thing they said their intention.",
      "and accept this from us. Indeed, you hear our prayers and you know what we are doing. And then after that Allah SWT says,",
      "those who submit to you and also from our children progeny, from our Children those who are a Muslim community Ummatan Muslimatan Laka a community that submits to you. And then Allah SWT says they say and their prayer and show us the way we should perform",
      "accept our repentance or turn towards us in mercy indeed you are the one who is most merciful and the one",
      "beautiful dua of Ibrahim and Ismail",
      "for all the people who are working in Islamic centers, Islamic organizations that when you build your Islamic center first of all pray for the city. Make this city a safe city. Safety and security of the city should be our concern. It should be out priority.",
      "safe area. Second thing, we should also be concerned about the economic well-being of the people, all people who are living around us. So we should pray for them, for everyone. And Ibrahim had this concern that first of all our intention must be pure and good so Allah accept from us",
      "and second thing is we are building this place the center of this masjid so make us muslims make us those who submit to you both of us be muslim they were prophets of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala but still there was concern about that that we should remain muslim should be continuously submitting to allah",
      "Islam is a process. Islam is continuous submission to Allah SWT. And then our children, our progeny, So we build the center, we pray that we be the people who worship and also our children worship. And we follow the path of Islam and our children follow the",
      "then he continuously teach us how to worship you in the best way, in the proper manner that we keep learning that and turn towards us in your mercy, in your kindness indeed you are the one who return often to those who turn towards you",
      "The last part of this Dua is Our Lord sent among them a messenger from among them. Of course, this was Ibrahim's Dua Ismail's Dúa for the coming of Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and he came",
      "of a long time, but he came. So Allah SWT accepted this dua for Ibrahim SAW and in its proper time Prophet Muhammad SAW came to guide the people. So his dua was that if a prophet be raised among them who will teach them the Quran, he will teach him the hikmah, the wisdom and make them grow in purity so we don't have to pray for a prophet to come because prophet has come and was the last prophet of Allah",
      "Prophet of Allah but we should pray when we build our Islamic center, our masjid. We should pray that we should have guides, we should teachers, we shoud have imams the righteous imam, the good imams who continuously teach us, teach our people, they are teach our children and make them grow in goodness important concerns important concerns Ibrahim at",
      "house for the worship of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and what a beautiful dua that is the model for all of us who work for the islamic centers and for the masajid we pray for the safety of the area we pray",
      "مسلمان ہونے والا ہے کہ ہم سب سے بڑی طرح پیدا کریں اور اللہ سبحانہ وتعالیٰ کی طرف سے صحیحت عطا فرمائے اور ہم اچھے دستوروں کو ملتے ہیں، اچھی امامات، اٹھے رئیس کے لئے ہماری معلومات میں اچکے لوگوں کے لیے اللہ تعالی نے اس کے خواهشوں سے مجھے آیا۔ اللہ ہمیں صحصہ کرنا چاہے ، وآخر دعوانا اور الحمد للہ رب العالمين"

      "that this Ramadan program, as I mentioned earlier is primarily intended to understand our relationship how to make it closer with Allah and as a Muslim until unless we develop our closer relationship with Allah",
      "and we determine our relationship with Him, and our status on this earth. We really cannot understand ourselves. And that's very important. And during this month of Ramadan, this is a great opportunity for us to develop",

      "may allah bless all of you accept our fasts our prayers our devotion and may allahu keep us on the right path and protect us i want to thank uh our brother islam",
      "who invited me to speak at this important gathering. The topic is how Ramadan brings us closer to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. The whole purpose of Ramadan is to establish our link with Allah subhana wa ta-ala. Ramadan makes it easy to connect with Allah. Connection to Allah",
      "is called Taqarruf ila Allah. Coming close to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala. Actually in Surah Al-Baqarah where Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la speaks about fasting. Allah says, And then after that it says,",
      "And then after that, the third ayah on this subject says,",
      "me so that they follow the right path. So you see that fasting, Ramadan and then immediately after that the ayah speaks about Allah's nearness, Allah's closeness. Closeness to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala we have to understand what is the closeness to Allah? And who are the people who are close to Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la?",
      "Allah and Allah is close to them. Closeness to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, a great spiritual master Muhammad Abdul Jabbar Nifari who lived in fourth century of Hijrah he says",
      "He is near, not like a thing is near to another thing. And he is distant, not as if a thing was distant from another thing So what is the nearness of Allah SWT? Are we talking about physical bodies that are near to each other?",
      "inches and yards. Allah's nearness is the nearness of mercy and Rahmah, Allah's Nearness is something that you have to experience and two people might be sitting next",
      "very distant, not near. Although Allah is close to everyone He is closer to us from even our jiggler vein but we are talking about a special kind of nearness and this special nearness is something that everybody has to realize for himself or herself",
      "This nearness is the nearness of rahmah, the nears nearness. Nearness of love and Allah said in Hadith Qudsi",
      "until I love him. So nearness brings love of Allah SWT. The angels of Allah is called Al-Muqarrabin, those who are very close to Allah. The prophets are mentioned as Muqarribin.",
      "He was from among those who were very close to Allah SWT. Our messenger, Prophet Muhammad SAW was very close",
      "You move towards him walking and he will come to you running, which is also a metaphorical way. Not in a literal sense. So closeness to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala gives comfort to our souls, happiness to our hearts. It takes away our anxieties. It brings Allah's mercy, forgiveness. Those who are near to Allah",
      "are near to Allah, Allah accepts their duas and bless them. Closeness to Allah requires keeping away from sins. Allah is good and He accepts only good.",
      "and he wants the people to be just. So one should avoid lying, cheating, deception. One should be just and fear others. Closeness to Allah will be realized with sincere faith and devotion. Allah says in the Quran, in this ayat al-Sajdah, in Surah Al Alaq, He says make sajdah",
      "and come close. Make sajdah, and come closed. The Prophet said A person is closest to Allah when he or she is in sajdhah. So nearness to Allah comes with nawafil, with reading of the Quran.",
      "with the dhikr of Allah SWT, with acts of charity and kindness to help the poor and the needy. In one of the hadiths that Prophet SAW said, it is also a hadith Qudsi, Allah will say on the Day of Judgment to a human being, my servant, Jabna Adam, O son of Adam, I was sick and you did not visit me.",
      "I was thirsty and you did not give me water. I was hungry and you didn't give me food. And the servant will say, Lord, You are the Lord of the world. How could I visit You? How could it feed You? how could I give You water? Allah says my servants so-and-so were sick if she would have visited him you would",
      "you would have found that with me. And if you were to give him food, you would find that with Me. The meaning is that when you are helping the poor and the needy and doing acts of charity Allah is near you and you are near Allah. So nearness of Allah is when we do good deeds",
      "السابقون أولئك المقربون Those who go in the good deeds ahead of others, they are those who are drawn near to Allah. Now Ramadan is really built for that purpose. Ramadan is meant for that",
      "to Allah SWT. It brings us closer to Allah because it is the month of the Quran and Quran is the book that comes from Allah. Here's the one who sent down the book so it is a book of Allah direct from Allah SWt. No one has made any changes, any addition, any deletion, any corruption",
      "It comes from Lawh Mahfuz. And this book came during Ramadan. The month of Ramadan is the time in which the Quran was revealed and the gates of heaven are open",
      "By the mercy of Allah SWT. To make it easy for people to do good things. The gates of hell are closed and the shayateen are put in chains. It is a time of mercy, rahmah, maghfirah. It's a time when there is liberation from hellfire. Every night",
      "The angels of Allah are calling. Oh the one who is seeking good, come, come forward. And oh the one",
      "my brothers and sisters. It is a time of fasting, it is the time of praying, it's at a time reading the Quran, it was a time for dhikr of Allah SWT and it is a",
      "these things in the right way, Allah will bless you.",
      "All sins are forgiven. And whosoever stands in prayer during the month of Ramadan with Iman and Ihqisab, with faith, and for the sake of Allah, all sins are forgotten. All sins have been forgiven. That is the blessing of the month",
      "of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Fasting is a very special thing. The Prophet said in the Hadith al-Qudsi that Allah says, كل عمل ابن آدم له إلا الصوم فإنه لي وأن أجزبه Every deed has a reward but as for fasting it is mine",
      "and I give a special reward. So Allah SWT will give you a very special reward The breath of the fasting person is more pleasing to Allah than the perfume of musk.",
      "He leaves his food and drink and his desire, sexual desire. He leaves it for me, for my sake. And Imam Ibn al-Qayyim rahimahullah says, Fast is a secret between Allah and the human being. No one knows.",
      "I mean people know that if we don't eat and drink, people will know that. But whether we are fasting for the sake of Allah? Only Allah knows. Only Allah Knows. So that's why it is called Sirr by an abdur-rabb. It is private between Allah and a human being.",
      "I leave my food, I leave drink. I leave all the things that are forbidden. I'm doing that for the sake of Allah and that's establish a link. That is special establishes a special relationship and that brings a special reward from Allah. So fasting teaches us sincerity and fasting develops Taqwa",
      "So that you may learn Taqwa. Taqva is the sum total of all the good deeds, all the values of Islam. Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said",
      "That you remember Allah and don't forget Him. And tashkurullah wa la takfuruhu. That you thank Allah and do not be unthankful to Him. Wa antuti'Allah wa la ta'siihi. And you obey Allah and not disobey Him. So zikr, shukr and taa'ah. Remembrance of Allah, thanks of Allah and obedience to Allah.",
      "to Allah. These are the things that we learn and we should learn from our fast. Fast, my brothers and sisters, is not just giving up the food and drink. Fast is giving up everything that Allah has forbidden. Who does",
      "not give up bad words and bad deeds. Allah does not care if he leaves his food in the ring. The Prophet said, there are many people who fast but they do not get anything from their fast except thirst and hunger. And there are",
      "and fatigue, and tiredness. So fast has a purpose, and the purpose of fasting is that we learn taqwa, we do good things to ourselves, our families. If somebody has any dispute, the Prophet said,",
      "I am fasting, I cannot get involved in that. That is the way of fast. Ta'zeem, honoring of the month of Ramadan, honoring fasting. So it's reward is immense reward, great reward and the greatest reward is acceptance from Allah. The blessing of Allah, special",
      "special reward from Allah. Fasting teaches us discipline, self-control. We see things a lot of things that are tempting now fasting tells us to stop eating and drinking things that",
      "with that which is halal, how important it is to control yourself from that which has been haram. That is the discipline. That's self-discipline. That training. And fasting teaches patience. Fasting teaches patience and patience means you have to control your",
      "control yourself. You want something but you control yourself and this is not the time to eat and drink I have to wait it teaches patience and the reward of patience is Jannah Sabr means sabr anil maasi sabr from things that are forbidden and sabr ala ta'at sabr on that which you are told to do",
      "Fasting teaches us Sabr. And fasting teaches us sympathy, Ihsan. وإنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ Fasting teachers kindness and allies with those who are kind. معيّة of Allah The closeness of Allah SWT as well as the company of Allah. This is for those who",
      "Allah loves those who do good things, who are kind to people. So ahsan, kindness, courtesy, care, these are the things that bring a person closer to Allah SWT. When somebody is fasting,",
      "the hadith says that if when you are fasting do not shout, do not get angry, do no say bad words or do bad deeds and if somebody abuses you bad mouth you then you say Allahumma inni sa'im I am fasting so fasting establishes special link with Allah",
      "link with Allah. So do five things in the month of Ramadan and do more these things if you are doing at that time but do more at this time, of course fasting every day, do not leave it without any excuse. If you have excuse somebody is sick, somebody's on a journey then Allah has allowed",
      "If you are sick, if you're on a journey, make it up some other day. But fast as Rasulullah has taught us to fast according to the Sunnah of the Prophet.",
      "And when you take iftar, make sure that you do it as soon as possible after sunset. My ummah will be on the right path as long as they delay their sahur until the last minute of sahur and they make their iftar early. That is the sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ. And then, do not miss your prayers.",
      "miss your prayers. Prayers are obligatory, just like fasting is obligatory. Prays are obligated. Five daily prayers you pray and decide five daily prayers and sunnah and nawafil. Remember special prayers of the month of Ramadan, tarawih prayers. You can do them at home by yourself or in jama'ah in the masjid which is better if you",
      "people and listen to the Quran. But even if you don't listen to The Quran because you don' have time or you are not able to come to the masjid, pray! Pray as much as you can. If you pray 8 rakahs, very good. 20 rakah? Yes. Pray 20 rakas. But if you cannot pray 8 raka, pray 4 rakah. But pray special prayer of the night in the month of Ramadan",
      "month of Ramadan and read Quran as much as you can. Read Quran, the whole Quran you should read at least one time in the month of Ramadhan. Listen to Tarawih prayer and then your own personal reading. Read with understanding and reflection to read the Quran",
      "and give charity, Sadaqah. Rasulullah was Ajwad an-Nas He was the most generous person. And he was most generous in the month of Ramadan like a blowing wind with generosity like that. So that is charity",
      "Sadaqat. And some people give their Zakat. I mean, they don't have to give Zakat in Ramadan. Zakat is supposed to be given when your one year is complete from the time you have Nisab until the end of the year. Until like 10 lunar months complete. So that's Hulal-Hul. But some people",
      "Why? Because the reward is more. If you do a Nafl as if you have done a Fardh and if you do Fard, as if your done 74, so reward is much more that's why a lot of people they give their Zakat during Ramadan. So give Zakat especially Zakatul Fitr also on Eid day or few days before Eid",
      "which is about one saw of wheat or barley, or dates. We estimate it's about $12 per person in the family for those who can afford it. So charity should be given and of course all the good deeds avoiding sin things that are forbidden",
      "So this is the training, this is a training. And being involved in fasting does not mean that you spend all the time sleeping and sitting. You can move, active, do some work help other people whatever good causes get involved with that.",
      "Ramadan in this way, which is not that difficult. People can do that then you will come toward the last part of Ramadan and that is the time when you do more prayers, more reading of the Quran,",
      "It is the peak of the time of blessings. And especially the odd nights, because it could be one of those nights, the night of Qadr. The night of qadr is better than 1,000 months. 1, 000 months not 1, 00 nights but 1, 0 month almost 83 years. One night a great reward, a great blessing of Allah SWT.",
      "and if possible the health authorities because of the pandemic health authority is allow then have a tikka in the masjid some areas they may allow that in some areas it may not if it is permissible you can do that and there is a great reward for article",
      "before the Eid day. So these are the things that we should do and if we do that with the sincerity of our heart, out of our belief in Iman inshaAllah our sins will be forgiven. Allah will forgive and accept those people. Now i pray to Allah SWT to make us among those who are closer to Him and bring us closer to Himself",
      "closer to Himself, bring us just as close to Himself. That is Allahumma inna nasaluka qurbaq wa qurbaman yuhubbuq wa hubbal a'mali latihi tuqarribuna ila qurbiq qurbah of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is the love of Allah. May Allah give us that love and may Allah make",
      "make us closer to him. And may Allah help us to do the right things, inshallah. The ummah of Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, may Allah bless them and those who are in difficulty, those who have problems in different parts of the world, may allah remove their difficulties. And through us inshaAllah, Allah bring the joy and happiness and peace in the world. So this world of",
      "divisions, this world of all kinds of conflicts and wars and violence. May Allah help us that we remove these things and bring the humanity to the path of peace and justice inshallah. Jazakumullah khairan. Thank you very much for your patience, for your listening. I pray to Allah SWT that bless you and bless me inshAllah.",
      "inshallah salam alaikum thank you very much dr siddiqui your speech is very educational and inspiring ahamed you gave us a very good explanation what closeness to allah means and gave us number of tips how to be close to allahu ta'ala your speech",
      "from it. May Allah bless you and your family. I'll now open the floor for questions from audience. You can type your questions on the comment box. Please limit your question to 30 seconds so I'll wait for your comments and inshallah if you have any questions we're gonna answer inshAllah and please go ahead if you",
      "and also as i mentioned in the beginning that you can ask uh the questions related to what dr sidiki has has talked to us and also if you have any question about aabsp um important since you can certainly ask",
      "Dr. Farooq, your library is beautiful. Oh, thank you JazakAllah. Is it your personal library or are you in the West State Library? No I am in the basement of my home.",
      "Okay. Where are you in? In what city? Yeah, I am in Champaign, Illinois. Yeah, so I remember that. You were my host. I visited you, mashallah. Yeah. Remember we brought you here a few years ago for our masjid program. Wonderful. Marik Allah. We have a question from Noor Haq.",
      "Haq. He asked how we can increase our Iman in the month of Ramadan? These are all the things that I mentioned in this message. That is these are the things for increasing our IMAN. Do everything with belief in Allah and seeking reward from Him",
      "reward from him, not from anybody else. Our fast is not to tell the people I'm fasting our past and not to show off. And we control ourselves and do things that Allah has told us in our Prophet told us because the Prophet example is the best example you know,",
      "upon the Ummah in the second year of Hijrah. And Prophet passed away in the 10th year of hijra. So he passed away, so that means he fasted nine years, nine Ramadan he observed. There is a great example of Rasulullah how he fasts and",
      "He used to fast other days as well. He used too fast Mondays and Thursdays, and sometimes he would fast three days of the month 13 14 and 15 So fasting has a great benefit And it shines the soul, it purifies. They say Zakat is the purification of money and Fast is Zakat of the body",
      "of the body and purification of the Body. So it is, we do that thing. And at the same time with the spiritual benefits there are also physical benefit in fasts. I mean of course we do it for the spiritual benefit for iman but our religion is a comprehensive religion. It says your body has right",
      "So take care of your body also. And that's why it is said in the same ayah that tells us to fast, if you are sick then don't. You are allowed not to fast. Allah does not want difficulty for you.",
      "a great opportunity of increasing our Iman, of strengthening our Imaan and also great opportunity for receiving forgiveness from Allah SWT. In one of the hadiths it is mentioned that the Prophet before Ramadan he wanted to give khutbah and he took one step on his member and he said Ameen",
      "And the second step on the member, he said Ameen. And the third step on The member is Amein and then the Prophet explained said Jibreel came to me and he said and Then he told me to say Amee'n. The first one is that person Is alive and healthy and finds Ramadan but does not get forgiveness of his sins That means it does not make pay attention to Ramadan",
      "So he said, shame on that person. May that person not be blessed. And the Prophet said, I mean. And then second one is that he found his parents both of them or one of them alive and also does not serve them, they should not show kindness to them and did not receive forgiveness.",
      "front of him the name of rasulullah is mentioned and he does not say allah so ramadan you can see that is opportunity for forgiveness and iman so sister who is asking about how to increase our iman",
      "fast in the month of Ramadan. Give charity, zakat. All these things are laid out for us. We have another question from Brother Ishaqair. He asked, children are increasingly getting impatient in today's world of instant gratification. How do we teach our children patience from a very young age? Since as you mentioned, patience is such an important object",
      "an object of fasting objective or fasting I mean parents should be the role model we are patient with them inshallah they will learn that so wherever Quran tells us to say something say that you should be",
      "and make us the imam, the role model for their pious and their righteous. And Allah makes me the one who prays and also my children pray. So first I have to pray. Mother and father you should be patient with your children. Don't lose patience but give",
      "But give them time and inshallah they will do that. And tell them, remind them also but at the same time remind them with patience. If you are telling them be patient and you are not patient with them then they will not learn patience. So be patient with him kindly. Somebody say Lord teach me patience but do it fast. Allah swt will give you patience inshAllah.",
      "patient, inshallah. So your children will be patient, InshaAllah if you are kind to them, patient to them and if they are anytime they ask you to say something or do anything, okay take time we'll do that inshAllah for you but inshAllAH not a wise thing but insHALLAH to do things there's a lot of people they say to their children inshALLAH but then they don't",
      "So when we say to our children, inshallah that you mean it. Somebody was telling me that his son was asking for something and he said, inshaAllah I said no, I want you to do it. Do this, inshala. So that means it. Okay. There is another question from Brother Islam. Can we pray tahajjud at the last part",
      "at the last part of night after praying wither after tarawih? The hadith says, Make the last prayer of your nights wither. So it is better to pray wither at the end. But if you have prayed wither already and then you woke up and you have time to pray tahajjud",
      "do that. It's not forbidden but the best thing is if you are sure that you're going to get up for this prayer then delay your Vaita prayer. But in the month of Ramadan we pray Jama'ah with a prayer otherwise regularly we pray Vaitra individually, but in the months of Ramadan Vaitar is done in Jama'ah and the collective Dua that is there which is very good to do that",
      "very good to do that so you can do that it's not forbidden but recommended this is not an absolute obligation but it is a recommendation it is better to do",
      "you go to sleep and then you get up and you pray before the time of Fajr, before dawn. So that is a time called Tahajjud. And that prayer was very good, very good to pray. Pray eight rakahs and if you cannot pray, take four rakah or even two rakah. Whatever you can pray inshallah.",
      "Another question from brother Muhammad Kabir. His question is, every year Ramadan comes and goes. However we do not see any change to individuals and the nation as a whole. Why? Can you reflect on this? Unfortunately many of us do things as rituals. Not as real things.",
      "things. So they are sha'een and they are mashaaeen. Sha'een are those obligations that you do, but mashaaen is the feeling. It should be done with the feeling of the heart. And Rasulullah said this fasting should stop you from doing bad things and saying bad words. So you should be conscious",
      "That's why niyah is very important. Proper intention. So in our aamalu binniyat, aamal are according to the intention. If you start doing that, we don't just fast because it is custom. The family is doing that so we do that but every when they have our scholars say that you make the intention when the month of Ramadan comes",
      "month of Ramadan comes that I'm going to fast inshallah for the sake of Allah SWT but every day remind yourself, everyday you make intention. The intention is very important so if we do the intention and we understand the objective maqasid the objectives of the fasting inshaAllah they will benefit from that. So there are ahkam and there are maqased al-ahkam",
      "There are rules and there are objectives of the rule. What is the purpose of fasting? We ask ourselves, why am I fasting? And for whom am I asking? What am I going to gain out of fasting? These are the things that will help inshaAllah. If there is no more questions by now then probably we should end",
      "we should end inshallah um we do not have any more questions so we have come almost to the end of our program i will ask dr siddiqi to make concluding dua for us",
      "وعزائم مغفرتك والغنيمة من كل بر والسلامة من كل اسم والفوض بالجنة والنجاة من النار اللهم اهدنا فيمن هديت وعافنا فيما عفيت وتولنا في من توليت وبارك لنا في ما عطيت واقنا وأصرف عننا شر ما قضيت فإنك تقضي بالحق ولا يقطع عليك نبارك ربنا وتعالى",
      "Allahumma inna nasalluka alkhayra kulla",
      "Allahumma inna nasaluka al-huda wa at-tuqa wa darajatil ula.",
      "Thank you very much Dr. Siddiqui for your time and in spite of having the difficulties that you faced",
      "face at the beginning of the program so may allah bless you give you a long life and good health and uh please make dua for us and for the activities that we are doing so that we can make more progress",
      "Jazakallah khair. With this we end our program. Our special thanks to Dr. Siddiqui for his valuable time and to Dr Nagibur Rahman who has facilitated the broadcasting on this program on Muslim Ummah of North America TV. Thank you all in the audience for joining us. Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Waalaikumsalam."

      "As-salamu alaykum. On behalf of the Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago, welcome to today's Quranic Clipsier session. My name is Dr. Omar Haque. I'm a dentist in Oak Brook Terrace. I am involved with Islamic Foundation, Islamic Foundation School and the Boy Scouts there. Our moderator for tonight",
      "For our moderator for tonight, we have our dear respected Dr. Muzammal Siddiqui. Dr. Zombal Siddique received a BA in Islamic and Arabic studies from the Islamic University of Medina, Saudi Arabia, and later went on to complete a degree in comparative religion at Harvard University. Since 1981 he has served as the director of the Islamic Society of Orange County",
      "He is the chairman of the Fiqh Council of North America. Internationally, he is a member of the Executive Board of the International Assembly of the Council of Ulama in Mecca, a member",
      "religious leaders of the world in a pilgrimage of peace. Dr. Siddiqui served as the president of ISNA from 1996 to 2000. We thank our platinum sponsor Muzaffar Mirza, DDS & Associates, gold sponsors Downtown Islamic Center and Zakat Foundation, silver sponsors Family Eye Physicians Dr. Muhammad Al-Khudari and Dr. Wasia Khadja Ahmed",
      "skin vein clinics Dr. Jodat Abudh and Mohsin. InshaAllah tonight our Imam will give highlights of Quranic guidance from Surahs 10, Surah Yunus and Surah 11, Surat Al-Khud. After the abridged tafsir we'll have a question answer session where you get to ask your questions in the comment section on your YouTube and Facebook. Let us welcome Dr. Mazamil Siddiqui to our live program.",
      "Thank you very much for inviting me to this wonderful program. I was part of it last year, so Ramadan Mubarak to the community and may Allah bless all of us. We are studying Surah Yunus and Surat Hud, Surah number 10 and Surah 11",
      "and can you have the first screen it's going to be yes before that can you go to the surah units as he has units oh yeah after that so both of these surahs are Makki Surah they were revealed",
      "They were revealed to the Prophet before the Hijrah, a few years before the hijra. It was at that time when opposition was very strong against the Prophet and his message. Although the surahs do not indicate that the hijr is going to take place but from the content of the suras you can see that there is opposition people are trying misunderstanding",
      "and making their criticism on the teachings. Surahs, both of these suras are named after the names of prophets Yunus Alayhi Salaam and Hud Alayhissalam. Yunus alayhi salam was in Mosul Iraq in the 8th century BC and Hud alayhis salaam was is the southern part of Arabia in Hadhramaut about 2500 BC",
      "So the surahs indicating, mentioning some of the things about the prophets of these prophets. Not telling the whole Surah is not about these prophets there are many other important points that are mentioned here in this Surah and interesting thing is that both Suras start with Alif Lam Ra actually from Surah number 10 to Surah 15",
      "to Surah number 15, all the suras, six suras they have Alif Lam Ra in the beginning. Except in Surat al-Ra'd Surah 13 that has Alif Laam Meem Ra So scholars have discussed about these letters that are known as Huruf Muqatta'aad unconnected letters",
      "And the real meaning is of course known to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala. There are many speculations, but one thing is very important that these letters whenever they're mentioned you will find something said about the Quran.",
      "and in a similar way surah al-raad but it is so there is some way of indication that these letters are there but as a message is coming",
      "The message is coming. Pay attention to the message. Let's go to next slide.",
      "The story of the Prophet Noah and Prophet Moses are told to remind people about the consequences of unfaithfulness and arrogance. And Prophet Muhammad is told to continue giving Allah's message with patience. Whosoever wants to believe, let him believe. And whosoever want to disbelieve, let",
      "So this is a summary, some basic points that are there, themes of this message. Let's go to the next slide where Allah SWT, the opening of this surah,",
      "is the message of wisdom and it is coming to a prophet allah says akanele nasi ajaban is it so surprising to people that we have revealed to a man among them they were saying that the people of mecca are saying at that time how come a prophet from among us has been chosen why allah has certain prophets throughout history prophets were chosen from among their own people",
      "deeds then they will see the consequences as well so give them good they warn them as well as give them the good news and give them",
      "but they're calling him that he's a magician, he is a sorcerer. And the message is not a divine message. Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says no this message is from Allah. This is not sorcery, this is a divine method and then after that the message goes on emphasizing who is the one who sent this message? Allah is the One Who created the heaven and earth sun and moon, they move night and day",
      "night and day, the variation all this. This is the one who has created the whole universe. He's the one that has given this message. And then you will find there are several ayat in this surah that talk about Quran. Let's move to another slide before that.",
      "When our ayat are recited, next slide please. The Prophet only conveys the message that is given to him and his message is the message of there is only one God. He is emphasizing the oneness of God, he's emphasizing",
      "People should change their life, obey the commands of God. Correct themselves. Some of those teachings did not suit them so they said to the Prophet, change it! If you change the Quran if you make some changes in the Quran or bring another Quran we'll accept it. So Allah says tell them, Allah is mentioning that what happening when our clear revelations are recited to them those who do not expect",
      "to meet us they say bring us a different Quran or change it. Say, it is not for me to change it of my own accord I only follow what is revealed to me for I fear the torment of an awesome day if I would disbelieve my Lord The Prophet is presenting the message as it is given to him by Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala So we cannot change the Qurans simply",
      "simply to suit other people or somebody say I don't accept that so why don't you change this no prophet is saying that I presenting it what is given to me it is not for me to change anything I cannot change the Quran I cannot bring another Quran I am giving it to you and then said say if Allah had not so willed I would not have recited it to",
      "before it came to me, how could you not use your reason? He lived 40 years among them. He did not recite anything. He didn't give them any message. But then Allah revealed to him so he presented the message. He said I live among you, you know Me now the message is coming to me so that's why I'm presenting this message and then what is this message? Let us move to the next slide It says that this Quran",
      "Quran is not devised by anyone other than Allah. It's only Allah has given the Quran. No one can, no one has produced this Quran except it is coming as a revelation from Allah.. It is the confirmation of what was revealed before it and an explanation of scripture. The Quran is in the same way",
      "just were before the Torah and the Injil. And it is confirming in two ways that is the same message that is there in the previous books that are given here, and then also the previous book spoke about the coming of a prophet so it is confirm what was said in the",
      "It corrects certain things that have been changed in those books. So there is no doubt about it, it is from the Lord of the worlds. If they say that Prophet has produced it, he devised it, Allah says then produce a surah like it or call on anyone you can beside Allah if you are telling the truth. The Quran is the message from Allah.",
      "and there is a challenge you find this challenge here in this bring another surah bring ten suras, bring another Quran like it whatever so different ways it is mentioned that if you are saying that Allah prophet has made the Quran then you and your fellows all you gather together and produce something like that Allah says again",
      "again inviting humanity and telling them beautiful words about the Quran that this book has come to you as a reminder teaching has come",
      "This has come to you. And this is the book of healing, healing of the diseases of the heart, hate, grudges, jealousies, anger, all of these things. The book brings a shifa for that. And it is a book of guidance as well as mercy. Guidance for this life and mercy in this life as well",
      "is, قُلْ بِفَضِّ اللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ فَوِذَٰلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَعُوا هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمِعُونَ Say in Allah's grace and mercy let them rejoice. It is much better than whatever they collect the worldly thing that they collect The message of God is the one that brings happiness to the hearts of the people because it brings mercy, it brings guidance, it is a healing So that is the purpose for which this book has come",
      "book has come. Let's move to the next slide please and then finally after going through all this because these are just highlights Allah says to the Prophet",
      "Say, people the truth has come to you from your Lord. Whoever follows the right path follows it for his own good and whosoever strays does so to his own loss. I am not your guardian. The prophet is not to force the message upon the people. The Prophet is to present a message and this message is it is your choice accepted or not accept it",
      "It is your choice. If you accept it, it will be good for you. And if you do not accept it. It is Your own loss. And then Allah says to the Prophet follow prophet what is being revealed to you and be steadfast until Allah gives His judgment For He is the best of judges so prophet",
      "patiently convey the message and final decision will be in the hand of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala whatever that decision will but your job is to convey the Message and present this to the people. That's the way Surah Yunus presented let me summarize its teachings The Quran is a book of wisdom, Allah has sent this Message to guide human beings",
      "guide human beings. The message came from Him who is the Lord of the universe. Those who believe will receive the reward and those who deny the message will be punished. Allah gives chance to people to correct themselves and repent. Man under difficulties prays but when his, when the difficulties are over forgets Allah.",
      "the message and they were saying we are denying the message why you're saying that the punishment will come, why the punishment doesn't come? The Quran says Allah is very kind. Allah is quick in His kindness, in His mercy but Allah gives time to the people to repent and correct themselves. And this is different from man's behavior. Human beings when they are in difficulty they pray to God and as soon as the difficulties",
      "The message of the Quran is from Allah. We cannot change it to please those who find it unacceptable. And the message of Quran is admonition, healing, guidance and mercy.",
      "Allah saved Nuh and those who were with him in the Ark. So, Nuh's story is mentioned briefly in this surah. In other places, in the Quran there are more details. The surah says that Nuh for a long time presented the message of Allah to the people but when they persisted in their sin and their denial then after that Allah says",
      "you prepare an ark and the people will be drowned. And that's how they were punished. And then Musa came after several prophets, Musa, came and he goes to Pharaoh and present a message to him emphasizing to him to do justice to Ben Yisrael but Moses also called",
      "Pharaoh also called Musa as a magician and he gathered his magicians and there was a contest in that the magicians were defeated. He did not accept, he was arrogant. Finally Musa took Bani Israel out of the land of Egypt and he pursued them. And then when they were crossing the river at that time",
      "When Israel was crossing and he himself wanted to go and pursue that. But the water came back and he was drowned. At that moment, he said I believe as when Israel believed but that was too late. So that means the time is when you are alive, when you have all the possibilities at that time,",
      "When the death is approaching and one sees the death, that is not the time of repentance. The repentance time is before that in life. And then Allah mentioned that many nations were destroyed when they did not accept their prophets except the community of Prophet Yunus alayhi salam, Jonah. They are the ones who when Prophet Yunos left",
      "the town thinking that they are not going to accept and they saw the Prophet is no more there so they thought maybe the punishment will come and they accepted that. That means Prophet Muhammad should not despair. Prophet Muhammad Should not lose hope. Is it possible that these people who are denying now, they may accept? And this what happened. That's why he was told be patient and present a message. So the message will succeed inshaAllah",
      "Inshallah as it happened with Yunus that his community they accepted the message afterward and they came to the right path. Then we come to Surah Hud, Surat Hud the major theme is to remind people what Allah's grace and kindness and warn them of His anger and punishment for those who reject Him and ridicule His prophets",
      "In this surah we have many prophets are mentioned. The stories of the prophets are mention, story of prophet Nuh especially is mentioned in great detail and then you have a story of a Prophet Saleh. Saleh Alayhi Salaam was sent to the people of Samud people and they were on the northwestern part of Arabia",
      "part of Arabia and then Hud just like the name of the surah so this surah talks about Hud and what his story Hud was in the southern part of arabia and both of these prophets were early prophets but almost 2500 or 3000 years before the birth of Isa and Luth is mentioned",
      "is also reference to Ibrahim that angels came to give him the good news of the birth of a child and then Ibrahim asked what other tasks they have and they mentioned that they were going to Lut community and that community is going to be punished and Ibrahim was very concerned about that. The angel said",
      "that Lut and his followers will be saved but not the community. We have also the story of Shu'ayb who was sent to Madian, and then Musa's story is mentioned briefly because in the previous surah you have some more details now in this one you have a brief reference These prophets of Allah they were chosen by Allah",
      "They came to their community and gave them the message. And those who accepted the message, they were saved. And for those who denied the message arrogantly and continued in this life of sin and corruption and injustice, the punishment came upon them. So the Surah is actually... The tone of the surah is the tone of warning. And Prophet Muhammad when he received this message, he was very worried",
      "worried that if the people of Mecca will continue in their denial, maybe the punishment will come upon them. So all because of this worry, because of",
      "that people should change themselves, repent, turn to Allah. Otherwise they may see the consequences of their bad deeds. Let's move to the other slide. So the surah begins again with the same style, the purpose of the book and what is the call of the messenger?",
      "This is a scripture whose verses are made form and then set out in detail. That's what the Quran is, in the beginning the revelation was in short sentences, short surahs in a very condensed form and after that other Suras came in detail so it's set out into details from one who is wise all aware So Hakim and Khabir is the one sending this book Allah SWT",
      "and say prophets worship no one but allah i am sent to you from him to warn and to give good news the warning is mentioned before sometimes you have bashir before then the nazir and now here is nazir because in this sura there are more warnings that's why it says so ask forgiveness of your lord",
      "grant you provision until an appointed time so you will have life and His grace will come upon those who are, who have the merit to receive the Grace of Allah but if you turn away I fear you will be have torment on a terrible day. It is to Allah that you will return and He has power over everything let's move to next slide",
      "Rasulullah was facing different kinds of challenges and ridicules. And Allah has given him a consolation. He says, so Prophet are you going to abandon some part of what is revealed to you? Or is your heart constrained because they say why is no treasure sent down",
      "treasure sent down to him why no angel has come with him you are only to warn it is allah who is in charge of everything similar point was mentioned surat yunus now here is mention that they are saying that if he the prophet of god why does not have a lot of wealth why there is no treasure with him why angels are not with him walking and supporting him",
      "So these are ridiculous statements of looking at the message, what is the message? What is being said? So Allah says, you are only a warner. Allah will take care of everything. So Allah is in charge of everything, You are not in charge, you're a warners. You have to give the message. If they say that this message is made up by him, then you are human beings. He's a human being, you bring up 10 surahs like it.",
      "So, As we mentioned before sometimes the Quran says bring a surah. Sometimes the Quran say the whole Quran like that. Ten Suras like that so in different ways it's emphasizing point that this is the message from Allah. It is not made up by any other human being by any human being He has they say he had invented it himself",
      "then produce ten invented surahs like it and call in whomever you can before beside Allah if you are truthful, if you're saying that this is you can do it then go ahead and do it. Let's move to the other slide. And then Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala mentioned that there is, there are two groups, the people who believe and the people",
      "blind and deaf or the people who see and hear. Can they be equal? So what is important is that people should see and here, see what is going on, who is the messenger, what kind of personality he has, who are the people following him and listen to the message. And they are the one who will be the people of faith",
      "Those who believe, do the good deeds and humble themselves before their Lord. They will be the companions in paradise and there they will stay. Then after that we have stories of prophets of Allah. We mentioned before several prophets. Seven prophets are mentioned and their communities are mentioned. Let us move to the other slide",
      "slide. Mentioning the stories of the prophets, then Allah says these are the accounts of some towns that we relate to you. Some of them are still standing and some have been moved on, let me destroy it. We did not wrong them, they wronged themselves. Their gods which they called beside Allah",
      "Allah, what of no use to them? When what your Lord ordained came about they only increased their ruin. So shirk does not save the injustice does not say people what saves is righteousness and belief in one God. And Allah says",
      "warning such as the grip of your lord when he grips the towns in the midst of their inequities his grip is terrible and severe so this is a lesson one can learn from the history look back at the history and what happened to nations who were arrogant who made corruption who did injustice who had disbelief what happened",
      "of people of loot alayhi salam and uh median the people of median and all of these people learn from their from their history stories and take some lessons move to next slide emphasizing a point follow like",
      "If only there had been among the generations before your time people with a remnant of good sense to forbid corruption on the earth. But those were only a few of them whom we saved while they just pursued enjoyment of plenty and persisted in sin. This is",
      "The Quranic call that is people should stand for justice. People should try to correct things. Allah said why there were not people who stood up for the right cause, reminding the people and telling that correction is wrong, stopping the correction. But many people they did not do that except a very small number of people.",
      "And what happened? The rest of the people, they continue in their luxuries, in their enjoyment. And that's why Your Lord will not destroy a town unjustly while its people were acting righteously. If people act righteosely, if there are group of people who correct things then Allah's mercy will come, Allah's blessings will come. And then Allah says it is of course",
      "This is of course people's choice. Allah does not force people. If your Lord had willed, He would have made all the people righteous or united and people are divided except those who are in the mercy of Allah. So the point is that Allah has given choice to the human beings and sent His prophets, His books to guide people",
      "why the final judgment is in the hand of Allah and Allah SWT will bring it anytime here in this world or suddenly it will come in the hereafter وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لَأَمْنَا أَنَّ جَهَنّمَ مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ And that is Allah's decision that those who remain corrupt then they'll go and become the fuel of the hell I will definitely fill the hell with both jinn and mankind May Allah save us from that",
      "So let's look at the summary of this Surah Surat Hud.",
      "The fate of those who disbelieved in Prophet Noah, including his son. Even his son, he did not listen to him. Noah called him and he refused. He said I will save myself. I'll go on the mountain. And there's a moving description of the fate of Prophet Noah's son.",
      "denied Allah's message and they were punished. The message of Prophet Saleh, the sign of the she-camel when someone stood and killed the camel. And then after that the punishment of Allah came upon Samud. Prophet Ibrahim received the angels and the angels gave him the good news but at the same time they also mentioned what they are going to do to the people of Lut alayhi salam who were corrupt and who were involved in sin.",
      "The punishment of the people of Prophet Lut mentioned in this surah. The prophet Shu'aib, whose people were involved in business but they were cheating in business. They were making corruption in the land and he reminded them but didn't listen to him so they were also destroyed. And then Musa alayhi salam, he came to Pharaoh who was mighty ruler",
      "that his power, his people, his forces are going to save him. It did not happen. So what is and then I mentioned the purpose of these stories. The stories are not just for the sake of stories. Their stories are there so that we learn some lessons. Prophets were denied before and Allah says to the Prophet Muhammad continue presenting the message with patience. Final judgment belong to Allah alone. Final",
      "judgment is not in the hand of anyone, it's in the hands of Allah who will decide that. But prophets and prophet followers' job is to pay attention to the message, follow it themselves, and give it to others. May Allah make us among the people who follow the ways of the Prophet.",
      "so dr huck you have any questions that are there or maybe we're disconnected then",
      "Assalamu alaikum. Waalaikumsalam. Jazakallah khairan for a beautiful explanation. Really, this is one of the best moments of explanation I have heard. I have few questions, I guess. Is it essential to be a Muslim to receive Allah's mercy?",
      "Well, I mean it is in the hand of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala but Allah has given us a message and we have to convey the message. We are not the people who judge ourselves. The judgment is in",
      "the judgment is to Allah. You don't get involved into that. JazakAllah, it's a good answer but follow up to that is so is it can we say that the kuffar will be in hell for sure? What is that I didn't get... Can we say for sure that the Kuffar are will be In Hell or they are entitled to some mercy from Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala? Those who deny after knowing them",
      "they themselves in a bringing ruin upon themselves the judgment upon themselves but those who are um who do not know or those who uh who repent and turn to allah of course Allah swt mercy will be there for them Jazakallah you know in quran muslims are referred as millat e Ibrahim can you tell us uh can you explain this a little bit better as to why we are referred",
      "as Millat-e Ibrahim rather than Milla the Prophet.",
      "Ismail came to Mecca and they both built a Kaaba and prayed to Allah that Allah raise a prophet from among them. And that's the Prophet Muhammad came. So is millah, is the community, millah is the family, milla is the way of Ibrahim.",
      "And there are a lot of similarities between those who take the name of Ibrahim, that is, Jewish people and Christian people. So in a sense these similarities are emphasized by mentioning that this is the same tradition that was given by Ibrahim.",
      "common ancestry, commonality there. Allah is saying that go back to that tradition and that tradition is the tradition of Tawhid not Shirk. That tradition is a tradition of justice and righteousness so everybody says that go look at your own heritage and your heritage is good. Your father was Ibrahim why not follow that way in that sense? So it is mentioned",
      "in the sense of encouraging people. Thank you so much Dr. Muzamil Siddiqui for this beautiful presentation about Surah Yunus and Surah Hud. Thank You for watching the program brought to you by the Council of Islamic Organizations",
      "We thank our platinum sponsor, Dr. Mazzafa Mirza, DDS & Associates, gold sponsors Downtown Islamic Center, Zakat Foundation, silver sponsors Family Eye Physicians, Dr Muhammad Al-Khudari and Dr Wasiha Khadra Ahmed, Alpha Motors also a silver sponsor.

      "of Surah 14, Ibrahim and 15 Al-Hijr. Thank you for watching. May Allah accept all our fasting."

      "Allah SWT addressing the Muslim Ummah. And thus we have made you a middle nation, a moderate nation,",
      "towards mankind and the Prophet is a witness to what's you so the duty of Muslims is not only to live by Islam themselves in their own life but the duty",
      "Be witnesses in their own life. Shahada, personal shahada. That means being standing as a witness. People see you and they recognize you. Who are you? People of commitment to Allah. People of good values. And then also you say whenever there is a chance to speak, you speak about that. In a good way, in a nice way.",
      "أدعو الى ربك بالحكمة والمعزة الحسنة واجادلهم بالتي هي احسن ان رباك عالم بمن هو ظل عن سبيله وهو عالم بالمهتدين",
      "and with good preaching, with good communication. And those who argue with you, argue with them in a nice way, in a better way. Your Lord knows those who have gone astray from his path and those who are rightly guided. So communication of the message is the duty of every Muslim.",
      "There are people who are inviting to their ways. Secularists are inviting them to their way, atheists are invited to their own ways. People are doing all kinds of things. They have commercials all over taking over and people of other religions also invite to their their ways but Muslims in general, they are very negligent on that",
      "on that they feel shy to speak about that so it is important that muslims say who you are this is our duty this is the way how we should be working also and the quran has used several words in sunnah and ahadith of the prophet sallallaahu alaihi wasalam they speak a lot about that",
      "Sometimes the word da'wah is used. Da'wah means calling. Sometimes the world is tabligh, conveying. So you invite or you go and convey the message to others. Sometimes, the word is amr bil ma'roof nahihanil munkar. You enjoin what is right and you forbid what is wrong. Sometimes that word is shahada la takoonu shawadaa ala an-nas.",
      "that is stand as witness for the sake of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala sometime the word is remind because you are reminders give the good news to the people inspire the people with",
      "Warning in the sense of telling them the consequences of not following. The right ways. And sometimes it is called. Tabheen. Explanation. And also you have the word Tawasi Bil Haq. Tawası Bil Sabr. That is counseling, speaking. Admonishing people about what is right and also patient. And then Naseeha.",
      "So here you have 10 words, 10 terms of the Quran and every term can be explained in great detail. And you have verses in the Quran on this subject. So this is the essential duty of Muslims. And it is part of a natural outcome",
      "Just as if there is light, you will see the environment is lighter. If there is ice, you'll see the enviroment is icy, cold. Cold. If you see fire somewhere, everything will be warm. So in a similar way, if there's Iman, Iman has to come out and show itself.",
      "in the right way. So Iman is this natural outcome of Iman, the stronger the Iman that it's going to spread, it's gonna go around and that is the word of Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la. And it is also our desire goodness for the people. We love what we have, we want to share it with others, we share with humanity",
      "To not be a believer unless you love for others what you love yourself. So, you love that you will be saved from the punishment of Allah. You love that if you go to Jannah, you'll love yourself and be successful in this life and in the eternal life. And you wish the same thing for others.",
      "أكثر من هذا الحب الذي يكون فيكم، أكبر من أن تتحدث عنه لأخرين. كان النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم قدر على العالمين وما رسلناك إلا رحمة للعالمين. والرحمة كانت لجميع الناس. لذلك كنت أريد أن أرا أن الجميع يحبون هذه الرسالة. رسالته ليست فقط للمغربين. رسمها ليست لجنوب عصره، ولكن رسائله لجوار جميع المشيخين.",
      "We did not send you except for all people to give them the good news and also to give him the warning. So that is the way of Prophet Muhammad because he is the messenger of Allah, and he is giving the message of Allah. But it is very important to understand what is our da'wah? What are we inviting people to?",
      "inviting people to. If you look at the Quran, you will find in the Quran the word da'wah is used. Da'wah ila Allah. We are not inviting to any particular party, political party, nationalistic party, something for our own interest. We want to gain some power or something like that. No. Our call is towards Allah. Da'dah",
      "دعوة إلى النجاة مَن يدرُّكُم إِلَى النَّجَاتِ؟ أتطلب منكم أن تكونوا حفظين حفزون هنا في هذا العالم وفي المستقبل",
      "and many other expressions you find that. So this is the basis of the dawah, of Islam. The dawah is not so we take over or we become powerful or we dominate. No! It is to help others for the sake of Allah. And it should be done with ikhlas.",
      "Dawa is for every person, not only any particular race or color. For all people because the message is for all people but it should be done first of all you become your own as an example if you invite others and you yourself are not practicing this is that",
      "أدعو إلى الله على بصيرة أنا ومن اتبعني",
      "with understanding, I myself as well as those who follow me. And it should be given to all people but especially we should start from ourselves, from our homes, from families, relatives, neighbors and coworkers. Those should be the first people. You yourself are negligent",
      "you go outside and invite other people it's not going to be very good so we should try to see that we ourselves become an example role model for the humanity so we invite each other we invite our own people who one first a cool ahlikum Nara protect yourself and protect your people from hellfire",
      "Sahaba and the prophets of Allah swt, they used to do that. But there are certain important ways to follow for this message. First of all good relations. In order to invite people to the path of Allah you have to have good relations with them. Within your own family as well as with your neighbors you have",
      "because people listen only to those whom they find kind, good, courteous, polite. So that's why good relations are important for building, for giving the message of Allah. The wisdom, hikmah. HikmAH is",
      "Do what is good, the way it should be done. At that time it should to be done so know how to speak, to whom you speak? What is the way to speak to people? If you use appropriate time, appropriate language, appropriate gestures, people pay more attention to that. That's what hikmah is. Al-ma'idah al-hasanah The preaching should be in a good way if you're presenting a book,",
      "written in a good way. If you are presenting a speech, speak nicely. If your telling them to go and see a website or online some program, well they have to present it the right way then it will be effective. And also those who argue, the argument should be done either the purpose of the argument is not defeat that other person",
      "The purpose of the argument is not to win. The purpose is, or the argument, is to create better understanding so that person understand what is being said and also the gradual approach. The whole message you give at the same time a person will be overwhelmed and say well this is not for me but speak slowly",
      "If they accept that, then you give them the daily Salat five times a day. Then tell them about Zakat and other things. So it is something as a gradual approach. No compulsion like Iqraha Fiddin. Islam does not accept compulsion and also no of the language of respect,",
      "of other religions, other faiths. Respectfully talk about others. Islam says that you should not abuse other people's faith. You should not abusing other people personalities. So yes, you present your argument without any abuse, without putting down anybody. Convey your message and it is up to them if they accept it good for them. If they don't accept it then you have done your job.",
      "And our mission and the purpose of our dawah is not converting the people. Our mission is to convey the message in the most beautiful manner. You cannot guide whomsoever you will, only Allah guides whomsoever He wills. So leave it to Allah. Don't use any devious method",
      "لا تستخدم أي طريقة مفتوحة أو تصدقها ويشعر بالأغنية والمزايا لكن بطريقة جيدة، فإنك قد عملت نفسك",
      "لبينا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه الطيبين الطاهرين",
      "وكذلك أرسلنا للأهل الذين يتفكرون في كتاب الله والمعرفة منه وأيضاً تبقى مدارسهم.",
      "من أصدق بكتاب الله سبحانه وتعالى فهم كيف يفعلونه ويطلونه حق تلاوته",
      "رسالة تشير رسائل الله لذلك هذه بعض المؤمنات التي نحتاجها إلى القرآن وان شاء الله اتمنى ان يكون هذا الحافظ الجديد وهذا كل الناس الذين تعلموا القرأن يستخدمونه بطريقة صحيحة",
      "وعلى آله وسحبه وعلي من انتبعهم بإحسان إلى يوم الدين خصوصا على الخلفاء الأربعة أبي بكر وعمر وأثمان وعالي وعلا السيدين الشهدين أبي محمد للحسن وابي عبد الله الحسين وعلمهم فاطمة الزهراء والعمي المعزمين المكرمين عند الله والناس الحمزة والعباس وعل سائر الصحابة والتابعين",
      "ومن تبعهم بإحسان إلى يوم الدين وأن معهم بفضلك وكرمك يا أكرم الأكرمين ويا أرحم الراحمين اللهم عز الإسلام والمسلمين الله إنا نسألك العافية والمعافاة الدائمة والفوز بالجنة والنجاة من النار يا حي يا قيوم برحمتك نستغيث أصلح لنا شأننا كله"

Allah says in the Quran, O you who believe be mindful of Allah have the Taqwa of Allah as you ought to have His Taqwah and do not die except in the state of Islam",
      "That means live in Islam all the way until the end of your life. Islam is a very beautiful religion, its teachings, its message, all aspects of Islam are great and beautiful. One thing that our religion emphasizes very much is that believers should be active.",
      "to do things. So religion in Islam is not a matter of feeling good, it is the matter of doing good. Unless you do good there's no use just feeling good and it emphasizes that believers must work and work hard and work until the end as much as they can",
      "And also, it is important to understand that in Islam there is not a sharp division between the religious work and the worldly work, the secular work.",
      "secular work, the religious work. All of them are religious as long as they're done in the right way and as long they're doing in obedience to Allah. So the work must be right and good and Quran has emphasized good action many places more than 75 times",
      "emphasize the work amilu s-salihat, doing the righteous deeds. So work should be done with the consciousness of Allah and with the conviction that everything is recorded and it is going to be shown",

      "Abjeeb has not been informed about what is in the books of Musa and the teachings of Ibrahim, the one who was most faithful. That is, no-one can bear the burden of another on the Day of Judgement. And human beings will not find except whatever he endeavoured and his endeavour is going to be shown to him.",
      "him and then he will be given the full recompense. And to your Lord is the ultimate return. So this is the basic principle that whatever we do, is recorded. Whatever you say",

And not those whose Books will be giving to them from behind or from the left hand and make us proud of our book on the day of judgment.",
      "Read your own book and you will take account of yourself. There are two hadith that I want to mention in this context. One is reported by Aisha. She said,",
      "فرأى أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من جلده ونشاطه فقالوا يا رسوة الله لو كان هذا في سبيل الله فقал إن كان خرج يسع على ولده صغاراً فهو في سبيل الله وإن كان خرض يسعة على بوين شيخين كبيرين فهوا في سبل الله وان كان خرج يسعت على نفسه يعفها وهو في السبيل",
      "It was passed by the Prophet and the Sahaba saw this person very active, moving very fast for his worldly business. So they said we wish that he was doing that in the path of Allah.",
      "Allah. So the Prophet said, if he is going out to earn for his children, little children it is fisabilillah and if he's going out take care of his old parents it is Fisabilillah",
      "to other people, in front of other people that is also fisabilillah. But if he's going to show off and to brag about himself then it is the way of shaitan. So, going for your business doing your work whatever your profession as long as it is done in the right",
      "With the right intention, it is fee sabi'lillah. So fee sabih lillah is yes coming to the masjid praying, fee sabihi lillah fasting in the month of Ramadan, fee Sabi'liillah going to Hajj, fee Sabeeliillah struggling in the path of Allah Subhanahu wa taala all these are fee sabilillah but at the same time fee Sabi'liillah also that you do your mundane activity but keeping Allah in your mind",
      "Keeping Allah in your mind and doing it in the right way. There is another hadith that is mentioned by Anas, he said, the Prophet ﷺ said,",
      "Anas says that Rasulullah said, if the last hour comes and one of you has a plant in his hand, if he can not to move, not to stand up before planting it, let him plant it. Because he will receive the reward for that.",
      "So, last hour has come and he was doing something planting something. And the Rasulullah said don't give up do planting if you can do that. This is very very vivid kind of message that do the work continue doing the work encouragement to do the",
      "And here it's not saying that, you know, somebody else will say if the last hour comes rush to the masjid and pray. And give up everything else. Don't pay attention to your family, don't pay atttention to this and that. Rasulullah did not say that. Continue doing your work. If it is a good work continue doing that because you'll receive reward for that too. So that is encouragement to work.",
      "and also at the same time it says that do not despair, do not say unless I see the fruit of my work what should I want why should I work your job is to work in the right way and the results are in the hands of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala so put your trust in Allah subhana wata'ala",
      "is right, your amal is right. Your deed is right and your intention is right InshaAllah you will see the reward for that. You may be able to see the fruits of your action. Now Faseela is a palm, dead palm seedling. And if somebody put that in the ground it may take 8 years 6 years by the time the tree will grow up and bring the fruit.",
      "and bring the fruit. And here is the last hour, Qiyamah is there. But Rasulullah said no go ahead, let him plant it because it is your action you're doing that will bring the reward. So do whatever work you are doing continue doing good work",
      "but of course in Islam there are priorities. In Islam, there are certain things that you have to do so whatever you do it in obedience to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Action must be based on the Sharia, the principle that I've given to you about halal and haram between right and wrong and then also Sharia tells you what is fardh",
      "and what is Sunnah, and what mustahab, what is halal, what haram, what makrooh. You all get those categories to follow those categories so your priorities must be there you have to understand your priorities and also your intention your intention must be Ikhlas sincerely for the sake of Allah",
      "So, a business sincerely with honesty and truthfulness in the right way then you will see the reward for that. You go to school, go to college your study is there if it's the right intention Inshallah you'll see the rewards for that so that is the beauty of Islam It does not separate religion from life but live your life",
      "Have your family, have your children, have you business. At the same time remember your prayers, remember your duties to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, huqqullah Remember your duties towards your family. Remember your duty is toward the community, toward the people around whom you are living, to your Islamic center, to neighbors Muslims or non-Muslims",
      "Muslims and non-Muslims. And also remember your duties towards the environment, towards the resources, all of these things that are called حقوق الله حقوقة العباد حقوا الشياء حقق النفس All these haqouq are mentioned. You remember that fulfill those and you will receive the reward from Allah. And at the same time, you have to understand that there are priorities",
      "priorities called and they are whatever you do understand what is first and what is after that and then also what are the consequences of your actions whatever action you take understand the consequences pay attention to that so use your wisdom",
      "All of this is religious action. All of these are part of the Deen. The Deen does not take you away from your life, from your business, from activities but actually all of this a part of that. And if you do some of these things, live your life with your family, with your business and work and fulfilling your obligations there will be reward for that. Everything will receive reward for it.",
      "reward for that. Rasulullah said there is sadaqa in everything that you do, you are with your spouse, you're enjoying your family life and this is a sadaquah, this is charity, this good deed. Sadaqah means that you are giving charity to your wife but you are meaning that you have been kind to her and this you receiving the reward for",
      "that Allah SWT mentioned in the Quran number of places but Allah says those who believe and do the good deeds we shall not deny them deny the reward of someone who is best in his action",
      "you who believe and work righteous deeds that he will surely make them succeed in the land as he caused those who were before him to succeed. And he will establish for them their religion which he has approved for them, and he will change them from a state of fear to one of security. They will worship me not ascribing any partner",
      "live thereafter, it is they who are rebellious. Allah has promised that the way of success is to be aware of what is going on, understand the realities, pay attention to the world, education, business, commerce and relations with other people",
      "obligations, your rights of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. If you fulfill that in a most comprehensive way, in a wholesome way then this is the way of success and Allah subhana wa ta-ala will approve that. This is what Islam stands for. So Islam does not say don't do anything just be praying and fasting and all these things",
      "These things are very important, but at the same time say that do this. At the same whatever you're doing make sure it is halal. Make sure it's right. Be honest, be sincere, be truthful. So Tajer who is sadiq and ameen feels like somebody who is working for the cause of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala giving his life for the Cause of Allah subhana wa ta-ala",
      "they are all standing in the same way. So may Allah give us understanding of our faith and make our life, the life of goodness, the live of truth and sincerity and our relations with all people in the right way.",
      "Alhamdulillah, alhamdulillahi rabbilalameen, wassalatu wassalaam ala sayyidin mursaleen, nabiyina muhammad wa ala alihi wa sahbihi tayyebeen at-tahireen. As we are involved in our businesses, as we are",
      "understand what is going on in the world, what is happening to other people, what",
      "protest and we should write to the authorities, the people who are speaking on our behalf, who rule. We should speak to them and tell them what is going on. And there's so many things that are happening in the world. I especially draw your attention to the situation of Muslims in India. There are many other places but at this time",
      "especially. They are the large community of Muslims that are going through a great difficulty and in the state of Karnataka, the state is forbidding Muslim women, Muslim girls to attend classes with hijab and this is the first time happening in India. There's Muslims who like number of Muslims have been living there for centuries now",
      "Now they are not allowed in that state to have their hijab. And this kind of discrimination, which is against the Constitution of India, which it's against the tradition of India is now happening. So it is important that we should be aware of that and express our opinion, send letters",
      "about that tell them what's going on as we do that about Kashmir and they do that what Palestine as we did it what Burma I will do that work China as you do the other places now with the new situation has come back and comes around so it is important that we should be aware of that and should pay attention I pray to Allah swt to help the people who are suffering in any part of the world everywhere",
      "وعلى أمهما فاطمة الزهراء والعميه المعظمين المكرمين عند الله والناس الحمزة والعباس وعلي السائر الصحابة والتابعين ومن تبعهم بأحسان إلى يوم الدين وعنّا معهم بفضلك وكرمك يا أكرم الأكرمون ويا أرحم الراحمين اللهم عز الإسلام والمسلمين",

Assalamu alaikum Pervez, wa alaikom listeners. It's great to be here. Hope everybody's enjoying their summer. Yeah that's right well summers over schools are back but for some of us yes some of those I guess just depends where you're at in the country that's why some folks are still enjoying their nice summer and others are just back to the grind that's",
      "That's right. And I guess we wanted to quickly give an update to something we had talked about last time, and for those keeping up with the story of our cousin, Asim Ghafoor, alhamdulillah, by God's grace, he is back with his family. He was released and safe and sound with his",
      "Yeah, Alhamdulillah. I think it was a month and end, a month of just probably extreme worry by the family and by all of us who know and care about Asim. So yeah, Alhumdulillah is a huge relief to know that he is back home with his family and healthy and safe. Alhamdullilah.",
      "have on the show. I think Omar and I both wanted to have him on the",
      "the delight and the honor and the good fortune of sitting with Dr. Muzammal Siddiqui, who I consider to be truly one of the giants of the American Muslim community, someone who's been an absolutely tireless leader in our midst, and we have this amazing opportunity to sit with him. And I think what really for me separated when I...I've told you the story, Omar that one",
      "if Zaki and I first started it so many years ago, was really to capture the story of people like Dr. Siddiqui. In fact, you know, I remember even thinking about Dr.",
      "Yeah, I mean, you know, I enjoy all these conversations. You know me, I'm a pretty social guy. I like talking to people and just interacting but some of the conversations also have the added benefit of just spiritual uplift and this conversation inshallah provides that so yeah, it's definitely an honor, definitely a privilege",
      "to you also for just making it happen. Yeah, like I said, I mean, yeah, I owe a lot of gratitude to Moise who sort of was instrumental in putting this together. But yeah, like i said, not only is he one of the giants of our American Muslim community but also, I think he represents a style of leadership, someone on the national stage pre-internet sensation,",
      "respected as a scholar, as a thought leader, as the leader in our community without all of the fanfare. You know, without all the fan fare, you know this was before the age of social media, this is before the ages of I think a lot of the sort of celebrity preacher culture that we've talked about on the show but it's become emblematic in the Muslim community so again it's just a real honor to be able to sit with Dr. Siddiqui",
      "Just a quick bio about Dr. Siddiqui, I mean, Dr. Mazamal Siddique was born in India in 1943, received his Islamic education at Darul Ulum Nazwatul Ulema, which is in Lucknow, India. He graduated from the Islamic University of Medina in Saudi Arabia in 1965 with a higher degree in Arabic and Islamic studies. And then he received his MA in Theology from Birmingham University in England",
      "University. Dr. Siddiqui has worked with several Islamic organizations in Switzerland, England and the United States. He has served as leadership among various Muslim organizations and centers. He's served two terms as president of ISNA, Islamic Society of North America. And since 1981 he has served right here where we're sitting today which is the director of the Islamic Society",
      "Assalamu alaikum Dr. Siddiqui, welcome to the Diffuse Congruence podcast. Waalaikumsalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. Thank you very much for coming.",
      "Capture the stories of, mashallah, the leaders whose shoulders we stand on today as a community. And you're certainly one of those and one of the pioneers of our community, mashalah. So we are very honored. We're sitting here in your beautiful office in Orange County. So that's even better to be in your home, as it were, or a place that you've called home for, what, 20 plus years now, mashAllah? Even longer. More than 40 years.",
      "in 40 years. And just echoing that, it's definitely an honor and a pleasure to be here. And as I get older, I think we realize how difficult it is just to raise children and balance just living in America with helping out the community. So, we appreciate it more and more as we get older and you know, raise families ourselves and get entrenched with just the busyness of life. So yeah,",
      "but also the time today. I thank Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and all of this is by His bounty. Mashallah. And we have a lot to cover with you, and I want to be mindful of your time as well. So, as we mentioned in the biography, you know, you were born in 1943 in Rampur, India. I think there's something sort of special about Rampor. I've heard you on other occasion or I read somewhere that the name Rampore itself was another name for the town",
      "name for the town originally and it changed i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about those sort of early experiences you had um rampur being of course a town in uttar pradesh uh ramport is about 120 miles east northeast of delhi um yes i mean its population has now grown to almost 400 000 people but at the time when i was born what 100 000 people",
      "So from Indian standards, it's a small town. It's a city but it has history. It was a princely state during the British time and then after the independence of India, it was merged with the Indian Union. Its rulers were Muslims",
      "So it is a city of Islamic culture and Islamic literature also. In the Urdu language, people talk about Lucknow, Delhi, and they talk about Rampur. So famous for its poetry, for its literary work, great poets. The Nawabs of Rampura were great patrons of learning as well as for an established very good library.",
      "and during the time of the first Nawab of Rampur, Faizullah Khan they established a library purchased lot of manuscripts from all over in Arabic Persian Urdu and other languages so it has more than 12,000 rare manuscripts actually Wow! And so it's known as Raza Library",
      "a library and it is now in one of the palaces of Nawab Hamid Manzil and lot of people come from all over to visit the library. It has beautiful Jamaat-e-Astead, it has other schools but when I was growing up at that time Jamaat Islami of India moved its headquarters",
      "quarters, Rampur. So many leaders of Jamaat Islami came and they were visiting the city also so we had some of the prominent leaders scholars who are there and they established an Islamic school primary school which is called Dar Sighah Islami and it was a boarding school for boys",
      "And so I was in the boarding school, although it was not too far from my home. It's only about 20 minutes walk from my room but my parent wanted me to be in their boarding school more in this Islamic environment and tarbiyah and all of these things. They were very concerned about that. My father joined Jamaat Islami",
      "with the influence of his friend, Maulana Muhammad Abdul Hayy who became later my father-in-law also. So Maulani Muhammad Abdulhayy and my father were very close to each other. Maulano Muhammad AbdulHayy was the founder of Maktab al-Hasanat and he used to publish many magazines Al Hasanat, Noor, Hadi, Ujala and other publications. He was a great",
      "a great writer, prolific writer. So he's the one who influenced my father to read the books of Maulana Madhudi and join Jamaat-e-Islami. So I grew up in that kind of environment which is very religious environment. My father was a government employee civil servant and he had a very good position but",
      "found that his job would not allow him to offer his prayers on time. So he left that and he was looking for other kind of works in business. Alhamdulillah, he did quite well after that as well. And I have... We had nine siblings including myself. Big family Mashallah. We were five boys and four girls.",
      "My two sisters passed away. The eldest one was married to Maulana Muhammad Yusuf Islahi, and the youngest one was not well so she passed away So we are now seven I'm the eldest son We have four other brothers and three sisters now Two sisters actually yeah now so Alhamdulillah it's a good family",
      "good family. My parents were very concerned about our Islamic upbringing and he wanted very much that I study Islam and become a scholar and an Islamic person with Islamic education. You know, that's very interesting because the two things you mentioned",
      "are things that we think about today for our kids. You know, being able to pray at work also making sure that our children are raised as Muslims I think maybe some of us take for granted that in Muslim countries it was just automatic but it sounds like we actually had families and parents fathers and mothers had to make effort even back then to pass on Islam to their kids It's a reminder, it didn't just come easy",
      "tension and an effort even back then. I'd love to hear about just life as what the Muslim environment was like back then, and even your description of living with minorities in India. That's something that sounds very interesting to learn more about as well. Or living as a minority in India because you know... May Allah bless them. They were very observant of their religion. Go to masjid regularly for prayers and make sure that we pray.",
      "my mother she one time he told me that if you pray 40 prayers in the masjid with jamaah and first takbir i will give you some price so this was like 40 days I continued doing that and then got used to it and also reading quran every day",
      "of hearing the recitation of the Quran. So may Allah bless them and give them the place, give them honor in the Jannah inshaAllah. InshaAllah, I mean so you mentioned one of the things I was curious about obviously this is pre-partition India. In your early childhood what were some of the interactions with people of other faith communities",
      "When partition happened, you know what were those? You know how is that? Rampur had large Muslim population although they are also many Hindus and We were very it was peaceful city the relationship between Muslims and Hindus They were not a people of other faiths and some Sikh. Of course, right they came from Punjab area settled in that area so",
      "relationship was very good and my father was well respected by Hindus also. And we had some good neighbors from the Hindu community so the relationship was almost like you know people of same town, same thing. So we never had any problem with the Hindu",
      "was born in 1943 and 1948 you have the establishment of Pakistan independence of India division of India right so there were some Commotions demonstrations You see that and then we used to hear a lot of riots taking place in the city called Baradabad Which is only 17 miles from Rampur and in Bareilly also, so those circles by cities had problems",
      "cities had problems but somehow with the blessing of Allah SWT, the city of Rampur remained peaceful. One of my mother's uncle was Maulana Muhammad Ali Jawahar and Shawkat Ali so Maulano Muhammad Ali and Shawkati these are the people who were known as independence leaders",
      "were involved in the independence struggle of India. He went to the Round Table Conference, to London and there he made a saying that if you want to go back with independent India otherwise you have to give me a place for my grave here. He died there but his grave was in Jerusalem so he's buried",
      "When I visited Mr. Laksa, he visited his grave and prayed for him. So we were very proud of that, that he was involved and he was a great writer in English, published magazines and is a poet as well. Muhammad Ali Jauro's influence is there. Yeah, and then you mentioned, of course, who would become your brother-in-law or Moulana Yousafzai",
      "Maulana Yusuf Islahi, Rahimullah who passed away in 2021 just last year we lost him. He was your sister's brother I mean excuse me sister's husband? Yeah my elder sister's Husband Okay and so you ended up after I think primary school You went to the school that he was at or he was right where he what was the relationship?",
      "So, I finished my primary school in Rampur Darsgah. We were thinking to go to some school and Maulana Islahi was just married to my sister so he suggested that I go to Madrasa Salislaah being the brother-in-law recently married of course my parents listened to me much more so he is the one who accompanied",
      "me okay to sir I'm here Adam girl I was there and then admitted and of course the teachers at the end they recognized my analysis like he very much and respected him so I was admitted and well treated because being the brother of an unusual sign but unfortunately after a few months",
      "flu epidemic. So a lot of people got, the students got sick and the teachers got sick, and I got sick. And that was difficult. Yeah, I think this is the 1958-57, 58-59 flu I've heard about. Correct? Yes. In India, yeah. Good memory. This thing, I was already homesick. Now, physically more homesick when I'm sick. Right. And you're just a teenager as well, correct?",
      "Yeah, so I then my parents called me and said to come back. I went back So I spent about three months in mother's solace law in try me awesome I don't claim any that I Got much from there But I met well enough for us and it's like the great scholar of Quran and other scholars I remember I used to go in the afternoon",
      "to go in the afternoon to Maulana Akhtar's Bangla and some students used to gather after Asr there. And Maulanan Akhter used to make very good tea, so I remember drinking some tea with him and learning but at that time of course was very young. He is one of the prominent students of Maulanah Hamizuddin Farahi",
      "manuscripts of Maulana Ahmed Hussain's writings. So he and Amin As-San Islahi were classmates. Okay. Yeah. MashaAllah. So, you know, I mentioned, of course, I knew the connection but Maulano Yusuf Islahy, I have a distinct memory when I was 12 years old we were visiting India. We're from Hyderabad. And my uncle who was very interested in my",
      "very interested in my, you know, tarbiyah and my like making sure that I had the resources that I need. Took me to a bookstore and just bought me just any book he could find off the bookshelf. I think that he wanted me to or wanted to ensure that I read. And so in that collection there was obviously plenty of books by Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi Rahim Allah who of course we'll talk about him very soon but as far as fiqh",
      "He bought me everyday fiqh, which was the English translation of Maulana Yusuf Islahi's Ahsan Fiqh. Ahsan fiqhh, yes. Yeah, mashallah. So definitely connected to him from a very early childhood and at that time not even knowing Hanafi versus Maliki or whatever but the jurisprudence that I learned besides observing my parents was you know from everyday fiqi mashaAllah so very indebted to him and then years later I would meet him in Houston he came",
      "at the masjid. This would have been in the 90s, so he was, yeah, so we lost a tremendous amount. His book, San Fiqh, became very popular and it's still very popular. Yeah, I guess that was my point. The interesting thing is that this book was translated into English by, I don't remember the name, but someone in Pakistan and it was published without his name",
      "without his name, the translator's name was there but not Maulana Yusuf Slythe. And when Maulano came for time to America I told him about that so he was shocked. The book is published by somebody else's name not his name. So he worked on that and he asked me",
      "I reviewed the translation and then after that it was published in his name. Alhamdulillah.",
      "Muhammad As-Sulahi would become such a part of my vernacular. The edition that came after 1978, I think they have. Okay, so I don't know how old I look to you but yeah this would have been the 1980s. But yeah my point of mentioning that was just of course just again the connection but also everyday fiqh and everyday fiqi was such a... That was like the book that you would give a young child or",
      "wanting to learn the rights of the five pillars of Islam, you know? So mashallah. So now after you finish your even let's say high school level education is this where you go to...you consider your options and you transition to Nadwatul Ulama? Yeah, after I came back from Madrasat al-Islah of Sulaimir",
      "course recovering from the sickness and then so I spent almost a year-and-a-half in Rampur and at that time I did kind of went from one teacher to another learning Arabic and then also taking few exams in Urdu literature and Persian",
      "I went to Aligarh to take the high school exam they used to have an external exam for the external students so I had a high school certificate and so after taking all these certificates of Urdu literature and Persian literature",
      "I had a teacher in Rampur. His name was Maulana Jalil Ahsan Ndawi He has a famous book called Rahi Amal collection of Hadiths So I used to go to him every day to learn Arabic study Hadith and Quran And he suggested that I should go to Nadwa and pursue my further studies in Nadwa, and he told me that go and attach yourself to Abul Hasan",
      "Abul Hasan, our son in-law. So that's I became interested to go so I told my parent and my father and Maulana Yusuf Islai, my brother-in-law and we all went to Lucknow. In Lucknow I had my grandfather, my mother's father",
      "And then we all went together. There was one of my uncles, Sheikh Mushtansurullah, he was a prominent leader of Lucknow. He was also there. So we get like whole delegation, five six people. We went there to Nadoa and Maulana Abu Al-Hussein, he was very happy",
      "have breakfast with him so he has a big fuss and he said that oh that's very nice they'll have somebody from such a prominent family coming here to do it so I was tested which class I should go you know not do I had several program one is the primary education",
      "and then two years for Fadil, and after that research students for Fatwa and other things. So I was tested because of my knowledge of Arabic and Islamic studies. I was admitted to the fifth class. Instead of spending seven years in the Alim program, I started with a fifth year. And so I spent about three years in Nadua.",
      "Okay, because it was like a placement exam based on which exam. Yeah, so that's the exam and I passed the test very well throughout. I mean I was one of the very good students there actually I received next year following here I received some scholarship from NADUA, a small amount which was almost like 100 rupees. It was a good thing to have that like every get",
      "is 9.8 rupees every month. Stipend, yeah. That's amazing. Now at that time I imagine it wasn't much but 9-10 rupees bought you more than the purchasing power. Nice. So I studied there Hadith, Quran, Fiqh and Arabic language.",
      "interested to pursue Arabic studies and the Maulana Abbas Ali Nadwi's nephew, Maulano Muhammad Rabi Nadwi. May Allah bless him keep him in good health. Maulono Rabi was one of the teachers of Arabic literature okay and he was I was",
      "have some special classes with you to study some books in Arabic he was very gracious he accepted that and he says well the only time is that you have to come to my masjid in the evening and after the maghrib prayer I can give you some time so I used",
      "and then go to Covent Road where the masjid was, and go and pray Maghrib there. And after Maghriib he would pray his Nawafil so I have to wait and do my homework at that time. Then after that he will give me like half an hour. So I read several books in Arabic with him. Not only that but he used to ask me whatever I read",
      "Diary a summary of that and so this helped me to To write Arabic to compose our big I became quite good in composition of Arabic So it was reading out of a understanding out of the composition of other week, and not they speak not spoken Arabic We did not do there right but I was It helped you a lot. I thank him my love bless him and that is My knowledge of Arabic really",
      "of Arabic really I go back to him. Maulana Rabi Nadeem after the death of Maulano Abdullahi became the head of Nadwa and he is still heading Nadwa okay and he's a leader of Muslim personal board in India so yeah that's how we spent the time in Nadwa. So interestingly you're not",
      "a alumni, if you will or a graduate from Nadwa. We had Dr. Ibrahim Musa on the show in the past and so he spoke a little bit about this but it was from your perspective and I would love for your insight as far as I understand, you know, the Muslim intellectual history or Muslim intellectual tradition in India has various streams, if",
      "Then the Darul Ulum, Deoband. And so I was wondering where Ferengi Mahal ties into that? I don't know. I wonder if these are all tributaries that come from Ferenghi Mahal but regardless you have various strains. You also mentioned Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. So if you could maybe comment on kind of placing for our listeners these various streams and what may be some of the subtle nuances.",
      "almost it becomes like a negative but the differences if you will or the subtle nuances between these two, these various streams that were prominent in India at the time. The unique characteristics if you oh there you go.",
      "And very good, they used to emphasize that. And hadiths there was also close by a school called Madahirul Uloom in Saharanpur and then Aligarh University of course was more for secular education so Sayyid Ahmad Khan is the one who founded the Anglo-Mohammadan College. Right, that's what it was called.",
      "then after that it became university so this was for english education secular education science and all those things although they had islamic studies program as well uh so maulana muhammad ali mungeri and malala shibli nomani and others they are the one who thought that we should have an institution",
      "at secular education and it should be open not only to Hanafis but Hanafi, Shafi'im, Alika all the schools. It will bring closeness to all these school and people of Ahl al-Hadith persuasion. That's where Nadwa was established so Nadwa is more open. It was not restricted to one school of fiqh",
      "as well and then also there were some education of English. Of course the founders wanted it to have English science and other things but it did not have that, it remained with Islamic studies only. But it was open to all other schools and students came from all over India and other places as well. They had number of students from South Africa",
      "who were there. And Nadwa is still, Nadwa has now grown a lot. We used to have few hundred students at that time when I was there but now it has more than 8000 students at Nadwa. It's almost like a university. And so, I've always been curious about this the name Nadwi is that like a title or is that a family name? No, no, it's title. That's what I thought. It' s like people from Aligarh called Alig",
      "And people around Madrasul Islah called Islaahi. So this is not family name, but there was a group called Nadwa. Nadwa means gathering. Council. So it's Nadwat Al-Ulema, a council of scholars and the council of the scholars established Dar al-Uloom. The name of their school is Dar al Uloom",
      "That is the full name of Ndewa. And they were great scholars there, Sulaiman Ndwi was there and then other people. So Maulana Abul Hasan Lee Ndawi, Masood Alam Ndavi was his classmate, Maulanan Masood alam, Maulan Muhammad Nazim Ndowi in Pakistan. These are the people who were",
      "who graduated from Najwa and he was there when I went there. So, I had the fortune to be close to him and I used to go from my home where I was staying in my grandfather's home, I used almost two or three times a week on my bike in the evening as well so I used",
      "between Asr and Maghrib there. He used to have a, he used to a Majlis where people would come in to visit him, and also students would comes from upper classes. So I used to attend that and sit down and listen to questions and answers and his talks.",
      "And then you're spending time. And then, you know, it was nice time to have drink cup of tea with him. That's what I mean, right? Yeah.",
      "You said you mentioned your other teacher. It became very personal. Yeah, right, right. That's fascinating. They used to call me like son. I remember that one time I was there in Delhi and his Marana Abbasani was there. So he said to my father, he is like a son to me. And you remember that? That means it was impactful.",
      "Because you remember him saying that. That means it meant something to you at a young age. It must have been extraordinary. So what happens after, again just for the sake of time there's a lot to cover but I want to hit at least the highlights. After Natawatul Alama your studies they continue for quite some time so I'm wondering if you could take us through that journey a little bit. And I was in the last year of Alim",
      "lodging, travels. They provide tickets to go from your country to Medina. So I was excited when they heard that this news and wanted very much to be there. So, I mentioned to Maulana Hulusi and he wrote that. I asked him to write me a letter of recommendation. He was very gracious. He wrote a very nice letter. I wish I had kept it. I know. I was just about to ask you if you have a copy of that.",
      "So I received that letter and the university was admitting students from India also. And NADWA recommended few students, but my name was not there among them. So what I did? I very quietly took the letter of Madanapuram Sandhya and went direct to Delhi.",
      "and asked him to take me to the embassy. So he went, he took me to an embassy and I said I want to meet the ambassador so it was fortunate that he... I said, I'm coming from Olanabursundi and his letter so he allowed me to go and meet the Ambassador",
      "Yusuf Fauzan was the ambassador at that time so he received me very nicely and actually he had visited Nadua just about year before and he visited our class and at that when he visited the class I was reading something from the Hadith because you used to read the book and then after this",
      "was very good in reading Arabic so he heard me and he was kind of impressed that I read with correct pronunciation and correct vocalization of letters and all those things so he recognized me okay well then you read the letter and then he said okay go back to",
      "send telegram to the to Medina to this language no see and let you know what answers so I came back I did not tell anybody in another that I went there also one day I was in the class in Ottawa and somebody came said the principal's want you to come",
      "what did I do so I went there and I saw a smile on his face they said wow you have been accepted in Madina's language congratulations and but he said that they are saying that you have to be there next week Wow yeah and I was getting ready for the exam final",
      "so I said what about my exam so Malana Irfan was the principal at that time in Labrador he said you can go and then when you come in summer take the exam so we'll give you a special exam",
      "relief because I was thinking if I don't go next week probably I'll not be a clip so I was afraid to lose that so he said all right and then spoke also tomorrow person and he agreed to sir alright could we smithina you don't want",
      "him and he was excited very happy then after that I went to Rampur of course those days is not easy to communicate on telephone no cell phone just took the ticket and when they arrived my mother was surprised how come you're there as I told her this what happened father",
      "the muster praying Isha when he came to him and he was very happy so alhamdulillah then this I told you I have only two days I had to return to go to Delhi he woke up my uncle said we have",
      "He opened the shop during the night, purchased some fabric. And we went to our family Darzi. I love it. And he was excited. Oh, mashallah, you are going to Medina. So I'm going to work all night to prepare clothes. Beautiful. Yeah. So in two days, we were ready. You had outfits made and everything. Mashallah.",
      "MashaAllah. So you left in two days. Your father-in-law? Yeah, I was engaged to his daughter, Fadila and our engagement continued for almost eight years. How old were you at this time? At the time of the acceptance into the University of Medina? No before that when I was in Nadua.",
      "Sorry, how old were you when you... When I was engaged? I think 19 years. He said he was engaged for eight years because then he went overseas. And my khalda was only about 13. So she did not do anything about all this thing. Just like arranged things. That's right. Alhamdulillah. Your fathers were friends. But we knew the family. Families knew each other because they're living not too far. Only about 10 minutes walk or 15 minutes walk from there.",
      "You mentioned that your fathers were good friends. Yes. Was the journey to Medina by air or by sea? I know we recently had some conversations about how people would of course take boats. No, we went by air. But there was no direct flight from Delhi to Medinah. Actually, there's no direct fly from Delhi",
      "and then after that from Bombay we went to Dharan. This is myself and few other students from Nadua, all together so it's a group of five students. So you're sitting across two people who both have Dharon connections? My family my father worked for Aramco and his father taught at UPM. He came from a university? No of course he knows UPM yeah. We spent",
      "yeah until our flight was there because they were only one or two flights from daran to medina so we had to wait for that and uh so we stayed in the hotel that was paid by the airline and then we went to medin after that and this was there was somebody from the university at the airport to receive us",
      "We were given the accommodation in a hotel in Medina, that was the only hotel, one or two hotels at that time in Medin. So we spent a few days in Medinas. The hospitality of the university was for three days and then... And after that you had to find your own place? Then after three days they... I mean we went next day to University",
      "and got the admission. There was also a placement test, and some students went to the Sanavi, to the secondary school, and somewhere to Alia, the higher. So I was admitted to higher, and that was a four-year program. And the university had a hostel, and this was an army barracks.",
      "And there was, so they gave us a room there. Few students from NADWA were together and give us our furniture. So we had to go to those storage collectable bed and beddings and all those things and then brought them to our room. Of course we used to cook our own food and clean our rooms and wash our clothes,",
      "All of these things were there and then the classes are simple. Desks and benches rather, benches and thing and there was no air conditioning. Actually electricity was not there only a few hours at night we used to get electricity. Was this all of Medina was like this or just the university because it's brand new? This was 62, 62 is the first bed.",
      "So it's brand new. The whole university concept is brand new there. Not concept, but they belong to the university. So they were probably figuring things out as well, right? No, that's why I ask. Was it just a school where all of Medina was like this with limited electricity, etc.? So this was the facilities. 1962, you were the first batch at Medina. Yes, I was in Medina and this was a small university at the time. It was just the beginning, the first year of university.",
      "And the total number of students were about 250. So we moved to university and they used to give us a monthly allowance for earlier students was 300 real, which is good amount of money at that time. Yeah. So it was for our food.",
      "For our food and other expenses. And for Sanaviya, it was 250 riyal. So they gave us first allowance and we had no money at the time. Young students. And actually you probably had not traveled outside of India. This is the first time so you're meeting students from all around the world, correct? Yes, that's right. It was the first",
      "taking a plane. Yeah, and Medina was quite underdeveloped at the time or not it was not like it was today obviously. At that time the total population of Medina were about 50,000 people. Wow! And at the Haram not too many people except at Hajj time. Okay. So we had our classes from morning till Zohar time then you have lunch and take some rest",
      "And then after us the buses used to go from The University you're still about four miles From the harem Then we go to harem muster than Nabi Salah and we arrived there and then Go to haram, and that's where we spent the time from Maghrib from Asad to Tisha Wow And sometime he used to have a",
      "During the ordinary days there was not much crowd so I would go inside and sit next to the grave of the Prophet and read the Quran and do my homework. Or sometime at Sufah, in that place where the students used to sit.",
      "I used to do. And then sometimes you sit in the courtyard of Haram with all other students and talk, and sit down and meet other people. The Baqi was on the other side, you could just walk over to the baqi. Yes, yes. And of course in Medina there were people from all over the world. Right. So meet them learn about the lahajat of the Arabic different dialects of other people from different countries. Because you're encountering like Omar mentioned",
      "mentioned you're encountering people for the first time not only outside of India but even, obviously within the Arab world you're in countering like you said different. Still probably mostly Arab world and South Asia right? Probably not now of course you have people from the West and Far East and so forth and Europe even but back then it was did were there any... Did you ever come across anybody",
      "Middle East and South Asia? Yeah, I don't think I met anybody from America or Europe. Mostly people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and then also from Arab countries. I remember one time after Maghrib, I was praying in the courtyards of the harem, and somebody passed by and something he whispered in my ear. Even though I was",
      "So I was praying, but he whispered into my ear. And then after that when I finished my prayer, I saw this person had spread his own musalla and was praying. So I thought that he needed something. He needed some help. So took some rials from my pocket and put them under his musalla.",
      "travelers and he needed some help so I gave him and He came and he told me. I don't need money. I have a lot of money I don' t need any money, I just said to you to pray for me Then we became good friends Okay, I was gonna say that the fact that you remember this instance incident But of course then you became friends like you said um so at that time were there any",
      "I guess teachers that you would want to mention who were at Medina at this time? The actual teachers. The teachers were some of the very prominent people from the Muslim world. Of course, Sheikh Bin Baz, he was the vice-chancellor. I thought so. Muhammad ibn al-Ibrahim, the mufti of Saudi Arabia, was the chancellor and his assistant was Sheikh Bin Bad. Sheikh Bin Bal was the Vice Chancellor but at the same time he was also a teacher. Okay, so you took classes with him.",
      "You took classes with the best. He used to teach us Aqidah, you know? And we had Sheikh Amin Shonquiti, a great scholar of Tafsir. That's right. His famous Tafseer, Adwaa al-Bayan. He was our Tafser teacher and we had Nasruddin Albani, Hadith scholar, famous for it. Of course, of course. So he used to teaches Hadith. Amazing.",
      "Amazing. Especially Subulus Salaam, I studied with him. We had Sheikh Abdul Mohsen Abad for Hadith. It was, I mean, for Fiqh. So we studied humbly Fiqah and also Usul al-Fiqh, humbly Usul Al-FiQH. And then also a scholar for Arabic literature, Adab al-Arabi.",
      "And that was Sheikh Abdul Qadir Shaykh Abdul Hamd. May Allah bless him. So, and later came from Pakistan Moulana Nazim Nadevi. And Moulan Nazim is one of the classmates of Moulin Abu Rasaleh Nadewi but he was teaching in Pakistan",
      "he was brought to teach at Medina, to come to Medin and teach there. So he was teaching Islamic Ethics and when he came I...he came by himself without his family so",
      "I went to meet him and then also, I moved with him. And my brother was also there because he was by himself. He needed some help for that so we used to be there and help him. So after that he became the father-in-law of my younger brother. Who is this? Sorry? My younger brother Mudassir Siddiqui. Of course who's a lawyer.",
      "He's a lawyer. Yeah, I've met him once. He married Muala Nazim's daughter. Oh, mashallah! Okay, I did not know that connection. There are a lot of connections established. That's right. Mualana Nazim......daughter was married to Dr. Zafarish Haaf Ansari. And you... That name should mean something to you. I'm gonna have to go do a check later with my parents.",
      "Is best friends with your sister? From the who taught in was from Malaysia. Yeah, that's right Yes, yes, yes doctor the police help cause married to my daughter Other daughter and you're and his other daughter was married to your brother. He is married to you, brother Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes, it's not consignee. Yeah His daughter is best friends of my sister Oh from from the Haran days",
      "I mentioned. Was he at UPM? They were there, they were there in UPM somehow. And their father Maulana Zafar Ahmad Ansari who came to Medina and met him and then after that I spent some time with him in Geneva at the Islamic Center of Geneva. So we have a lot to cover and I don't know how we're gonna yeah so I want to also start being again I'm going to be mindful of the time and reach some sort of",
      "of ending point. I have a question that I've been burning to ask about Medina at that time when Medina was started and, of course you had the blessings of all Libra teachers in India, was there like an idea... how am i trying? I want to say this gently but I guess the ideology or the sort of the Aqidah",
      "Was there a very, you know, sort of prominent if you will Salafi or Wahabi ideological bent? Or was it pretty much straight Hanbali and say Athari or something Aqidah. Was it like that at that time? At that time it was university was like international university. It did not have only Hanbalis.",
      "Salafi and Wahabi thinking was there, but it was not pushed to students. We did not feel any pressure that you become Salafis. Salafist students were given preference. They were given better treatment.",
      "But we did not feel discrimination. We did not fear the pressure upon us. Nobody said to me that become a Salafi. Yeah. So, well, that's great. So then after Medina where do you go? Where does your continuing education take you? Yeah four years of Medina passed very fast. It was a beautiful time. Would you on holidays you would be able to go back? I used to go home",
      "I used to go home, sometimes to India and also one year myself and my brother with this we visited Middle Eastern countries. We went to Jordan spent some time there and then after that to Lebanon and Syria and then After that we went by ship to Alexandria And you spend some time in Egypt. So we traveled in these countries",
      "countries. You and your brother? Me and my brother, yeah. Any... Met some of the prominent scholars there. Yeah I'd be curious just kind of what you're at a very high level given the time what your observations about those countries were because i believe um there was probably a lot of opportunity to spend time with Chuyu and traditional and uh traditional scholars and so forth and at the same time i think those countries are becoming more and more secular right if i'm not mistaken mistaken is that right? Yeah but there was some stability there",
      "stability there. In Jordan it was 1964 so I was able to go to Jerusalem and all this west coast area, so we spent time in Jericho, in Jerusalem, Annapolis, Sultram, all these cities of and in Jerusalem we spend some time Alhamdulillah",
      "Alhamdulillah. And of course in Amman, so we traveled all over in Jordan it was easy. Okay, less politicized I'm sure. Then after that and then we took we went by car to all these places okay from Jordan we came from Medina to Jordan we come by plane and then",
      "I was also a lot Hama and Halab and other places and met some scholars Sheikh of Ghudda was the Hadith scholar, I met him and other people so and then Muhammad al Mubarak Mustafa Al Sibai",
      "and spent some time in Beirut, and traveled to the hills of Lebanon. And then we went to Egypt. Okay. Yeah. So in terms of your studies though, after Medina you go to Birmingham? Or am I missing something? After Medina I went to Geneva. Geneva. Oh yeah that's right. That's another big step because you're moving further and further away from India. In Medina when I was last year",
      "I was in the last year of my study, I met at one of the conferences that was organized by Muslim World League. Rabita actually was established in 1964 and I was there when it was established and Moulana Mahmood Moududi, Moulan Abbas Ali Nadwi, Sheikh Mahmoud Sawaf and other people, some people they came",
      "And I helped as a student of the university. I helped in the conference. So, Maulana Apollos Nadi for example he dictated to me some of his lectures and I just took notes and prepared for him. Just jealous in the nicest way. And then I met Saeed Ramadan there. I was going to just about to ask you about it. Saeed Ramadhan was one of the organizers of the conference there.",
      "Was he in Switzerland at the time? He was living in Switzerland. He was leaving his hotel. Yeah, this is our Ramadan's father for the head of the Islamic Center of Geneva and Hassan al-Banna's Son-in-law right yeah, so I I also helped him Do some some secretarial work for him some taking from notes and writing things and nothing",
      "So, and I loved his Al-Muslimun the paper that he used magazine that he was to publish. I used to subscribe to it and then actually promoted Al-muslimun among the students in Medina so he received me very nicely and then he said when are you going to finish your studies in medina?",
      "I'm going to finish. He said, would you like to come to Geneva? To help us at the Islamic Center? Oh, it's obviously nice to do that because the university were asking me to go after finishing my studies to Africa to teach at some of their schools. Islamic schools. Which part of Africa were they asking you to go to? Rhodesia. I don't know where that is. Where is that? They used to send to different cities.",
      "to different countries Ghana Uganda I think it's West Africa different places they have to send so they were asking me also to go there but I did not say anything but when I got this invitation from Siddh Ramadhan although it was nothing formal he simply just said that I was not sure whether he will really accept",
      "almost towards the end of my study that medina i sent you a letter that I'll be ready next month and you said to me that you want somebody to help at the Islamic center so if you like please let me know so he's he said yes you are very welcome and i will send you the ticket",
      "So I received the ticket to fly from Jeddah to Geneva via Beirut. Of course, I spent a day or two in Beiru and then after that went to Geneva. When I arrived in Geneva there was nobody at the airport. And I had no friends and it's my first time coming to Europe",
      "So I the only thing I knew from the address of the mic up almost limon carnivore A card number is a railway station. That's all you know, I thought carnaval maybe this the place where they sent it so I When I didn't see anybody I took a taxi and take told the text is kind of Or maybe assured him because I could not do you say God now my cardamom",
      "So he took me and dropped me at the railway station. What to do? I went to a telephone booth, but I had no coins. And I didn't even know how to use the coin phone. So I asked somebody passing by, he said that I have to use",
      "and put the number. So, telephone rang at the Islamic Center. People said, we are waiting for you. Where are you? Give me an address. Then they came. It was not too far from the Islamic center to Karnava station. Only 10-20 minutes walk. So they came and then they took me to the center. When I arrived at the",
      "And I was at the Islamic Center in Metmolana, Zafar Ahmad Ansari. His brother, yeah? His father. Father, sorry. Yeah, and he was very gracious, very nice. Actually, they were starting a class in French. So he told me that we are going to start a class, you want to join? So after arrival, two hours after that, I was in the class to study French. Were you able to stay? Continue, yeah.",
      "continue yeah we'll continue with that Alhamdulillah myself and Maulana Zafar Ahmad Nasari were classmates and I guess",
      "Not too many, but like eight, 10 people can stay. And we had students from Turkey, from England, from Europe, from Japan. So we used to be together and taking lessons from various other scholars who used to visit. Maulana Hamidullah from Paris used to come visit us. Muhammad Hamidallah. Hamid Allah, yes, used to",
      "There was the Imam there at the center, Sheikh Buzuzu, Rahimallah. He was from Algeria. So he was and other Mawlana Zafar Ahmad Ansari and Sheikh Sayyid Ramadan himself. So it was a good meeting place. Did you meet Tariq Ramadan at this time? At this time. TariQ was very young. Must have been right. Yeah, he was probably four or five year old. But Dr. Sayyed Ramadan asked me to go",
      "me to go to who to teach his children okay he had I think four or five boys and one girl and they were all very young so eldest was a man the say was called Abu Ayman I am an Bilal thought honey and yes sir yeah",
      "So they all used to come and I did not know French to speak to them so I used to speak in Arabic, and then you very little Arabic. The children yeah. They spoke at home their Arabic so I use to tell them read help me to reach Quran and also tell them the stories from the Quran. So I remember Tariq he used to",
      "And he was only just that young, probably four or five years old. But his elder brothers Ayman and Bilal they were the ones. So many interesting stories! I'm sure we could spend hours and hours just diving into all the details and experiences but we'd love to in the interest of time fast forward a bit to your experience coming to America. There's so much to talk about obviously after you came here",
      "what was the initial spark for you to consider making that big change from Europe, of course, to the United States? Yes I was in Geneva and then from Geneva I went to England to do my studies at Birmingham University. I got admission at Birmingham",
      "finish MA. I got a degree of MA and after that, I wanted to do PhD. I was thinking of several universities in England. There was the possibility to go to Cambridge University but one of my professors at Birmingham University recommended",
      "here at Harvard and so he also wrote a nice letter of recommendation for me. And he mentioned that there is a center there, Center for the Study of Religions at the Harvard Divinity School and it has international group of students and very nice place. So I got interested in",
      "So he wrote a letter of recommendation for me, good letter. And after a few months I got approval from the Center for the Study of Religions at Harvard and Dr. Cantwell Smith was the director of that center. So he sent a very nice letter of welcome",
      "also give you accommodation at the center for the study of religion and provide some scholarship so it was very helpful i was very happy with that and when I got that letter um so I decided to go to India to see my parent and uh my parents decided that I should not go to America without getting married",
      "married okay in 68 December 68 and then we returned to Birmingham and my wife joined me after a few months and we came together to Harvard Cambridge Massachusetts and I was received at the center they were given an apartment",
      "It was nice to be in that kind of environment with other students from various other religions. So there were some Muslims there, Dr. Abdullah Ghazi who was there already before me and he's the one who came to the airport to receive me. Wow! And his family was living there and myself and a few other people. There was Mahmoud Ayub from Lebanon was there. Of course.",
      "I think he just passed away, right? He passed away. Allah bless him. Allah Bless Him. Yeah. And they were Hindu students. They were Buddhists, Jewish and of course Christians. So it's an academic environment with multi-faith. We used to have our regular meeting every week for dialogue discussion on various topics and living in the center together",
      "and I was admitted first as a special student at the Divinity School. Take any courses that you would like so, and so I took courses in comparative religion world religions courses there and Alhamdulillah lot of coursework which was intensive program",
      "And then also I wanted to know about the Muslim community in that area. So there was Harvard Islamic Society, a small Islamic society but it was there so I joined that. Dr. Habibul Haq Nadwi was the president of the Islamic society. He went after that to South Africa and became professor at Durban University.",
      "And then after that, when he was leaving, he was trying to be finishing his PhD there. So he said I want to hand over the Islamic Society to you. So I became the president of the Islamic society at Harvard, Harvard Islamic Society. And remained as president for several years. Locally they were the Islamic Center of New England in Quincy, Massachusetts. So the people of Quincy came and they welcomed me",
      "me and they invited me to come and visit the Islamic Center there for 20 miles from Cambridge Massachusetts I had no car I did not even know how to drive but somebody used to come in and take me so it was very nice brother Nuri he used to take us me",
      "only on Sunday. They did not have Friday prayer. So actually one person said when I recover, said to them that you should have Friday Prayer somebody said well Friday means gathering Juma, Juma is gathering so we are never going to be having a gathering just Friday. Interesting. It was interesting kind of thing to hear that. Was um...I guess obviously the community at that time very small I mean even in the 80s",
      "and so forth. Is that what it was like back then as well? Yeah, very few people used to come but a lot of people used",
      "The students were mostly at Harvard Islamic Center.",
      "on Sundays. Got it. Anybody in the academy at the time who was Muslim? On the faculty? Like, I mean again, I guess in religious studies or Islamic studies? We had visiting professors. Okay. Anyone worth mentioning that you visited? Dr. Kamali was Hisham Kamali? Not Hishham Kamali. He was from India. He is a professor and other people used to come. And doctor, you mentioned Abdullah Ghazi. That's another name",
      "fortunate meeting. Dr. Abdullah Ghazi was a student and he was like you, a student. He was from the International Islamic University in Islamabad right? No, he was from India originally, from Aligarh University. Oh okay. He went to Aliggarh and then after that yeah he was in England for some time and then he came to Harvard. My father is only I think",
      "he moved, he brought him and my mother came. He was here earlier for studies but they came in 67 so that I'm kind of thinking of your experience in parallel to my father's and of course he started having children. My older sister she was born in 69 so I presume it sounds you know you're married but is your family growing? Is the Boston area becoming quote unquote home at this point? Yeah we lived in Cambridge not live in Boston right Cambridge",
      "Cambridge but going to Quincy and meeting with the people in Boston. It's all this yeah, it's like yeah About 20 or so Muslim families who are in that area and we became all used to meet quite often Yeah at Harvard or at Quincy And So it was not just academic work that whether doing I was also involved in the community right especially after becoming president",
      "with the Harvard Islamic Society, Islamic Center of Quincy. And then I found that there was MSA. So MSA became known and I became part of that. Dr. Ahmed Saqr came. Masha'Allah. And he spoke at Quincy Islamic Center and after that I joined MSA",
      "about that because I know MSA begins in the late 60s at the University of Illinois is that correct? Yes it was in Gary Indiana. The headquarter was Gary Indiana okay which is nearby but Chicago they were in Chicago and some in those areas that annual meetings used to take place understood uh the meetings were about 100 people 200 people like a small group of people and that early pioneer group i i know it consists of like Dr Barzingi",
      "Dr. Barzinji, Dr. Ahmed Sucker. Yeah exactly so these mashallah again standing on the shoulders of giants so as a community we are. It was very nice to meet that people associated with MSA and MSA had a religious affairs committee okay uh so they asked me to join the religious affairs",
      "And this committee was basically involved in deciding about Ramadan and Eid, moon sighting because it was an important issue at that time. And answering questions of students about family life and halal and haram, halal meat, all this kind of thing. So I became a member of that committee.",
      "the chairperson of that committee. So this way I was involved with ISNA, I mean with MSA at that time. And so far listeners who may not know the MSA becomes is the precursor to ISNA because you can imagine a group of immigrant predominantly immigrants but also indigenous peoples who are here there were students mostly. MSA started as a student body after 20 years",
      "and there was MSA, and there Muslim Islamic Medical Association, Association of Muslim Social Scientists, Association Muslim Scientists and Engineers. So they were this association all of them came together and they said that we are no more students some of us are professors some of the working in various companies so we should not call ourselves an MSA but we should have a",
      "have a community. So they call themselves ISNA, Islamic Society of North America. The Islamic Society Of North America came into being in 1982 almost 20 years after that. You know it's interesting my brother we just heard the founding the origin story of ISNA by the way listeners. Yeah absolutely. I want to focus on that if that's where you're headed. Absolutely now after ISNA MSA and all",
      "USA and all other bodies, they became affiliates of ISNA. And ISNA become like an umbrella body organization. It has its conventions and all those things. Of course. We definitely want to come back to ISNA and we don't want to leave out MINA. I'm involved at academic level at Harvard doing my studies, doing the coursework and all of these things. Alhamdulillah, I spent almost five years also",
      "also at Harvard and doing all this coursework and getting ready for PhD. So then I decided the thesis topic because I was involved in interfaith kind of thing, involved with study of religions so that's why I chose a topic for the study of Islamic way of looking at other religions especially the work of Ibn Taymiyyah.",
      "So that's I chose the topic and work on it for several years What what led you to focus on? ibn Taymiyyah specifically, I'm curious I'm one of their admirers of his work. He is a great is a giant of course of Islamic history philosopher Theologian jurist for an officer Prolific writer he had more than 300",
      "than 300 works. That's right. And some of them are multi-volume works, and he is among these people, he is the one who has written extensively on Christianity. Okay. I don't think anybody has written so extensively on Christianity as Ibn Taymiyyah wrote. So I found that one of his books called Al Jawab As-Sahi', The Sound Reply, it is almost 1,600 pages in four volumes that he wrote that.",
      "that he wrote that and this was written almost towards the end of his life uh he died in 1328 so before the so the book refers to many of his writings and it is not only his whatever he read in the islamic literature but you also studied the bible several versions",
      "very well aware of Christian history. So he read Ibn B'tarikh's history and he knew various sects and groups among Christians, and his answer is... There is an answer that was also written. This is the answer to a letter, a letter that came from Paul of Antioch from Sidon, Lebanon.",
      "Paul of Antioch wrote a letter to his Muslim friends saying that Prophet Muhammad was the prophet for Arabs only he was not a prophet for Christians so Christians don't have to follow him and then also I mentioned that Quran praises Jesus and Mary and the Christian people so that means Christians they are in",
      "right way there's nothing wrong with that and then for that it explains in his theology okay theology of christianity right so even at amia um i mean this letter was written about 100 years before even time yeah oh but uh it was circulating in the middle east a lot of people were receiving this guy this letter and was in the community was it also",
      "Probably, that might have been the purpose. But it was a... The environment was tense because of the invasion of the Mongols and all of these things. So in that kind of tense atmosphere this letter came and it was Shahabuddin Qarafi also received this letter and he wrote a very strong vehement answer. Really?",
      "Al-Fakhira ala as'ilat al-fajra",
      "in his answer. But it's very strong. Okay. It's very",
      "quest then from me, from the show. Please anything we can do, anything anyone you know because I think that's a very important piece. You would agree. I mean especially in this environment where I think Muslims are living in America especially in a Christian majority Muslim minority situation. There was a Catholic scholar who also did PhD in Chicago under Professor Fadl Rahman on the same book, on the",
      "I felt that uh no, no i'm sure we will still benefit from your Thomas. Michelle thomas mitchell okay michelle thank you No so I so I was in that environment and at harvard and of course I did not isolate myself just to academic right but involved with the community as well Yeah, and not only community in massachusetts in uh at cambridge But also on the national level right with the MSA",
      "Right, with the MSA. And traveling to different places and all those things. So I mean that's how it is. Well I definitely want to hear some of those experiences. I think you mentioned ISNA was formed in 1982? No no no no. That's what I thought I heard. ISNA sorry MSA okay yeah. So i wanna hear a little just about the 1970s experience because just as our preparation Pervez was um Pervez and I were talking about how there was a Hajj group",
      "MashaAllah, you are so well-learned and from so many different parts of the Muslim world. Diversity. There's a diversity there. A diverse, eclectic academic career. Was there an end goal in mind when you started? Or was it just the pursuit of knowledge and one thing led to another and your interests grew and expanded?",
      "at the Center for the Study of Religion under the leadership, Cantwell Smith. I did not find any antagonism, any kind of polemics. There was dialogue but not polemic. So I was not in a polemical kind of atmosphere and not anti-Islam or anti-Christian something like that this was not the point right so we were studying learning about other",
      "about other religions and having a kind of peaceful atmosphere. So I was in that kind of atmosphere, and there was encouragement of learning. Many great scholars there, giants of world history, world religions as well as Christian studies. So i took courses on Christianity and Christian history, the ethics study of New Testament and Old Testament",
      "I learned some Greek and some Hebrew, Aramaic. So I wanted to study that. And then so with this kind of background study, I was very much involved with the study and then family life and then community life. It was a busy time. Of course.",
      "even Nadwatullah, was there always an end goal in mind? You had the intention to becoming a professor or academia or imam. That was my primary goal, to go into academic life and continue teaching and studying and doing research. Understand. That's what I was doing. And so continued for work for almost five years, six years at Harvard",
      "at Harvard. I had children, my daughter was born there and then after that I had my sons, I have three sons, four sons, so three sons and one daughter. Your daughter is the oldest and she was born in Cambridge? Yeah Alhamdulillah.",
      "Around 1976, Muslim World League opened an office in New York and Dr. Amir Saqer was chosen to be the director of that office. So Dr. Saqar persuaded me",
      "Come and help establishment of that office in New York at the United Nation But when he is such a persuasive person Such a convincing process. Oh after Several meetings and calls and after goals and all these things Okay, I accepted that he would go on to become a master fundraiser mashallah So he definitely was persuaded. I accepted it and I moved from Cambridge to New Jersey",
      "New Jersey. The office was in New York and I found a nice place in Teaneck, New Jersey so I... They would go on to eventually vote a Muslim mayor? Yes! It's a very nice city. That's right. So I moved there with my family, with my children and the office was next to the United Nations. So used to go every Juma'ah there and pray at the United Nation",
      "people from different countries there and very often I used to give khutbah at their So it spent about One year or so at In New Jersey then I realized that I have to finish my PhD Can I just leave it you had done the course all the time? My thinking right that I used go sometimes to Columbia University library and continue doing something with too far to travel from",
      "to travel from Teaneck all the way to Columbia. It was not that kind of a way, like you go to Widener Library and everything is accessible. Wideners Library is a great library with more than a million books. Anything that you look for, you'll find it there. Then other libraries at Harvard, 90 libraries at that time. That kind of atmosphere I was missing so I told Dr. Amasal",
      "told dr. I'm sorry I have to go back and finish my PhD so they agreed and this is all right yeah go and but when you try to finish as quick as possible so alhamdulillah went back moved actually the whole household we moved back to Cambridge Massachusetts and he found another apartment at Harvard Peabody Terrace",
      "My parents were visiting, so they were also with us. Alhamdulillah and I started working on my thesis now Although somewhat a little involved in the community but mostly it was for thesis So it took me about five months to finish that In 1978 I submitted my thesis And alhamdulilah it was accepted",
      "then I decided, of course at the office in New York they were waiting. They wanted me to come back so I went back. So we moved back and that is a time when we went to Teaneck. Okay right. So Omar had asked about the now very famous Hajj trip that was sponsored. When I came to the Islamic",
      "In 77, 76-77 there was this Hajj group. I had very good contact with Imam Barisuddin and... By this point you hadn't met him already? At this point, you'd already met him? Yeah, we met him and then Imam Siraj Wahad used to come almost every other week to my office. Because he's in Brooklyn. We had a good discussion, Alhamdulillah.",
      "So at that time they decided to have Imam, you know, what is it? Imam Wajid Deen's father Elijah Muhammad. He died in 1975 and he became the head of the organization and he tried to bring the people closer to the Sunni Islam, to mainstream Islam",
      "he also told his imams of the black community that they should go to Hajj and Muslim World League hosted them okay so each one they purchased their own ticket but once they arrived Makkah they were guests of Muslim world league and their accommodation food",
      "Dr. Sakhal asked me to accompany the group he himself did not go oh, he was there Imam Siraj and a number of people many some of their senior Imams today they recognized that we were there so we actually had a charter flight okay yeah some of this I've heard because we had of course Imam Sirach has been on the podcast and he shared his experiences",
      "recall he was an Imam in Chicago, Imam Ibrahim Ismail. He's like the father-in-law to Shaykh Hamza. Anyway, he's from Chicago. He was there on that trip. Yeah, we were from Los Angeles. We have several Imams. Imam Abdul Karim Hassan, one of the Syrian Imams, he was with us. So we were together almost more than 200. There you go. Wow! It was a big group.",
      "And we were all in one plane. Yeah. And I used to go to the cockpit and speak, telling them about Hajj. Oh! On the journey? Yes. The charter plane like you said. At that time, long before 9-11. Of course, you could go into the cockpit. You can go and you can speak and do that. So it's for our charter flight. That's right. Nobody else except Muslim. Right.",
      "did that and in this journey also my wife was with me and she was with the sisters of the African community and so they had a good interaction one or so he spent almost two weeks yeah and that there were number of speakers from Arab countries scholars",
      "and at that time. From Egypt? From Egypt, and he spoke, gave several lectures. Amazing. And I was used to translate these lectures. Wow, amazing, masha'Allah. And then other people came. Yasir Al-Fat was there, and they asked me to translate him for you. So I had to do that too. And a number of other people. Right.",
      "good time, good conversation. And after... So I was at the center and at the office of the Muslim World League as the head of the religious affairs department. That means contact with all the Islamic centers in US and Canada and Islamic organizations",
      "to them, providing Islamic literature for them. When is the... We published a translation of the Quran of Marbuduq Piktal. Was by the Muslim World League? Muslim World Union published more than 100,000 copies of that. I've seen that edition. It was edited with certain minor changes and beautiful printing cover that was done. And they distributed it to Islamic centers. Wonderful.",
      "Wonderful. I'm really curious, kind of at the big picture level, are you starting to see now more and more momentum across the country with interest in Islam among the Muslim community? Or did that begin a little later in the 1980s? When from your perspective did you see kind of the shift and the acceleration of the interest and the the acceleration building of masjids and so forth? Slowly we saw the growth of Islamic centers",
      "Islamic centers in the 70s and of course, in the 80s became much more but they were there. So it was no more just student organization but a strong organization that was a community organization and this immigrant community and then for American communities so there was some interaction with the American community",
      "So after when we came back from the Hajj, that Imam Wael al-Siddin allowed his people, the Imams of his community to take more lessons. And then Muslim World League and Imam Muhammad University of Riyadh and Umm Al Qura University of Mecca together they organized a",
      "Organized a training program for imams and this program was heard it never will close to Chicago That's the one that in my memory. Yes, yes there what? Hundred amounts or so they came There were scholars who came from Mecca To give lectures And also I taught a course on comparative religion",
      "religion to all the imams so and this was like one month-and-a-half program hmm so they were staying in a hostel and now that rented by this is an all these scholars were coming from different places yeah in",
      "I went to my cover and I was at Harvard actually. I took a few days for weeks often And then when this training program happened, are you all fairly had finished my PhD? Yeah now That was 78 79 right and then So I was involved with the With Muslim or league",
      "League and the community work. And during this time I received an invitation from Washington, Islamic Center of Washington that they are looking for a director for the Islamic center because Dr. Abdul Raoof he was retiring after almost 10 years",
      "10 years of service. He was retiring and they said that we want, if you could come and take the position. So I consulted with people at Muslim World League and I got a leave of absence without pay of course. So they said yes, you can go so that's how I moved from New York to Washington.",
      "Because you're the first guest we've actually had on this show who's talked extensively about Muslim World League. Could you spend maybe just a few minutes for our listeners who are not as familiar with, especially in the 70s and 80s, that was a big name. That name is no longer as common anymore. You don't hear about the Muslim World Week except in history books. The Muslim World League was established in the 60s. I was actually there in Medina,",
      "the Muslim League was established. It was established during the time of conflict between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. So Abdul Nasser was, for Arab nationalism and all of this thing, there were some... Problems between Saudi and Egypt, so Egypt establishes its own groups at that time",
      "Saudi Arabia. They thought that to have a Muslim world, inviting people so first meeting was held in Mecca and many people scholars from all over the world were brought and they came and they said that Ramadan was one of the convener. And Muhammad Sawaf and Abu Rasul Nalini Nadawi and other people and Muhammad Udi.",
      "So it is a religious body, just like after that King Faisal established OIC. It's called Organization of Muslim Conference. Islamic Conference. Yeah, so it had its headquarters. That was the political body and Muslim only or the religious body. And then Muslim only started establishing offices all over the world",
      "all over the world and one of the office was for United States which was also for us and United Nations hmm and dr. Sarkar was chosen to be that the director of that office so there they had Islamic centers Islamic schools financially as well other ways people needed some help provided those helps",
      "and also sending teachers and imams to various centers, that means scholars either from overseas or from here. Their salaries were paid by the Muslim World League. So why did this organization kind of peak and then not really stick around? After 9-11, of course, these offices are all closed because what happened",
      "what happened in 9-11. Of course. The terrible thing is Saudi Arabia had to reduce its activity. I see. You're saying, because I stopped, I thought in the 80s, late 80s is when Muslim World League became less you know as famous as they were in the 60s and 70s. Dr. Sarkar left. Okay, see I think there was a lot of turnover. I left. And then other organizations I think also filled voids that were more national based. True.",
      "True. So we have other Islamic groups and organizations that came, these are more local organizations.",
      "an invitation from the Islamic Center of Washington which is, of course that beautiful it's with all the embassies beautiful building. When was it? It was very nice but at the same time it was a terrible time because of hostage crisis 1979 Iranian revolution and all of that That is the period of time? Yeah that was late so 79 yeah I came uh",
      "and hope that I'm going to be at the capital of the country, and a great center, beautiful center. But what happened? That I found almost every week demonstrations outside the center because it was very political atmosphere. Demonstration against one country or the other country, against this, against that. Student bodies making demonstration",
      "making demonstrations, people make demonstrations. And the center was it's like board of governors were ambassadors of the Muslim countries. It's in a row of embassies. I mean, I've been there right? So that can imagine if it's people protesting lot of political upheaval is going on then... I kind of felt that I'm not in the right place. Yeah, I see.",
      "about a year and a half. I thought you almost said an hour and a hal, because you were like one hour, I'm done. DC is enough for one hour that's all you can stand. So I was thinking to go back to my job at West New Orleans but at the same time not sure whether should I go or not go someone came from Orange County",
      "from Orange County okay and visited me and bless our brother Adam what I see who came and so he saw what was happening and you saw worry on my face they said look like you're not a happy happy here and we have established an organization",
      "And we are looking for somebody to lead the organization, be the director, religious director imam here. So come and visit us. If you like, you can join us. That's dangerous because one visit to California and you're sold. That was the first time I came to California. And here you are, 40 years. And they, of course, arranged my children to go to Disneyland.",
      "got into oh there you go that was the that was a selling point for them right it's icing on the cake yeah you gotta get everybody on the family on board right so by this time i came here and spent a few days and then i uh i went back to washington okay and now brothers from here from the slum society of orange county",
      "we'd like you to come, we'd liked you to go. My family and others they said let's go so we decided I came here in September 1981. September 1981 so this September will make 40 my math is not right. It's just been 40 years it's just",
      "yeah we just more than 40 years no i just finished this september will be 41 22. 41 yes yeah that's what i was saying i'm trying to do math quick you're the engineer come on so i am the center was very small center was really small but just one building and uh the old church that was converted into a masjid which we are using now several offices",
      "Property has always been here. At that time, what would you estimate the community? I mean on Friday we used to have like a hundred people for prayer and then we had Eid prayer half of the masjid was there. Was Islamic Center of Southern California already established? Islamic Center was there Dr. Mahirat Tooth was there",
      "Okay. Center in the county and there was another center, African American center in Los Angeles. In LA? In LA. Los Angeles? In Riverside, there were three or four centers at that time. Small. Yeah. And this was also a small community. Right. So I came and accepted. And your children said Disneyland. So, okay.",
      "I was living in front of the Islamic Center for Washington, nice big house. Three floors and nine bedrooms. But I came here just took a small house three bedroom and rented it. And then we started our life here in California Alhamdulillah. It was...",
      "back sorry yeah your mic yeah this is fun that's not worth it yes always better to stop and edit yeah sorry and then the other thing you use but something happened",
      "And then move this way you can still see darkness. Yeah, do you have the benefit that you are? Yeah, there's your benefit your benefit is you don't any gear yeah, so you can move exactly very good now this ship this around however you want it Maybe that would be a perfect okay, okay, and then just time check as well What time I don't want to keep you look 50 degrees. Yeah",
      "Yeah, okay. Where'd I where he said three o'clock? Yeah. Yeah So we can kind of skip to 9-11 base skip tonight No, no way. We want to talk a little bit about it's now 9-eleven and then what you're gonna conclude with your advice to the community Yeah What do you think some of the challenges are now obviously years after nine that's the really interesting part so let's talk So that would be the kind of agenda for them here. So I want you to yeah, you know Pace your story, you yourself according to those make I guess 3 or 4 main areas",
      "three, four main areas that we wanna cover. Okay? So you were in the middle of something. Remind me where we were exactly. What were you seeing? After coming here I found there was a lot of activity on the east coast but in the west coast not much. Few centers but they had not much activity. They did not know each other and all those things so I thought that we should do something to activate",
      "activate the West Coast and so I suggested to the community here that we should have a Sira conference. And so we had an international Sira Conference, that was something that excited the people, Sira and International and with my acquaintance",
      "scholars from overseas here and we organized that Alhamdulillah it was very successful. And then people said that we should have it again, and we started doing that every other year so we continued for almost 20 years this conference and it became like it put us on the map. I was gonna say... People scholars and those who come and",
      "Southern California community to come closer. So various centers, actually in the very first meeting we brought about the imams and the presidents of various Islamic centers to meet. And that became the beginning of the Shura Council of Southern California which was established later in 1995 but that was community relations so it helped",
      "help both growth of the Islamic society we started purchasing the adjacent properties so we have now about six acres of land and it's like society was surrounded by dog kennels by dog canals Oh 300 dogs on the right side this area",
      "This area just was known for dog kennels. Okay, yeah used to hear like Barking of the dogs at the time of prayers and all those things Yeah, when there were any rain or anything like that So it's I used to pray Allah help us so that we can get rid of this. Yeah And Alhamdulillah, so we are able to get clean the whole area. Hmm. Yeah The carry street was not a paved Street",
      "the street and sometime during the night people used to come and drink and throw the bottles on our property so I put a fence there and persuaded the city to make a paved state that have more light and all those things right so alhamdulillah clip area became clear and clean and safe for everybody and family started coming moving in this in this area right so Alhamdulilah Islamic Center developed",
      "a school here okay in 1983 we established our orange crescent school right which has become one of the largest schools and should i counsel my involvement and then also I became adjunct professor at California State University Fullerton. Okay. I started teaching there",
      "course in comparative religion and a course in Islam. I started teaching two courses there at Fuller University, then also after that I was asked at Cal State Long Beach to teach a course there and then Chapman University asked me so I could have, there was an offer that I become full time",
      "full time at the university, but I somehow got busy with all this activities here and with ISNA. So I did not accept that. Your involvement with ISNAM again, well obviously you were already involved with the MSA. Had ISNA developed like a fiqh council or that comes later? The Religious Affairs Committee became the fiqhh council. Understood. Dr. Tahir Jaber Alwani,",
      "He was the head of the committee. A giant. And he is the one who changed it to the Fiqh Council. I see. And in 2008, he wrote to me and he said, I want you to take over the FiQh Council, and so then I became the head",
      "I started actually reading a lot. Probably, obviously not your writings but Pakistan Link The Pakistan link used to do a column with you You did a column at the Pakistan link Pakistan link was a magazine here locally? Locally And so it was Q&A People would send in questions for fatwa essentially like fiqh questions and Dr Siddiqui would answer them But what Pakistan link did was amazing",
      "It was amazing. In the early days, this is like internet, you know, beta internet, not even Internet 1.0. This is internet, beta Internet. Pakistan Link had a website and they compiled all of Dr. Siddiqui's responses. So you would go there and it was searchable index. You know, this isn't still right for 90s. Yeah, it's pretty advanced.",
      "you know his responses like and then so then what i did was yeah saving the questions and answering them on a weekly basis that's right every friday also i started a radio program okay through pakistan kind of familiar with this thing your microphone set up so i used to have a weekly radio program in the beginning it was lectures that i used",
      "one hour. And then after that, I started doing the Quranic lessons. MashaAllah, yeah. So it continued for about 20 years or so. Wow. See now, that didn't reach us in Houston but Pakistan link, I remember the articles used to reach us and so then what I did was I printed them all out. This is old school. Printed out, you know, wasted a whole bunch of trees and then put them in binders. And we used to use your fatwas as like discussion conversations for our halakas.",
      "for our halakha in Houston. So you've been a part of my life for a very, very long time even though I wasn't part of your community here Mashallah. So then when I went to ISNA in 94' I finally saw you and said okay so this is Dr. Muzamil Siddiqui. And years later we would invite you to Houston with the organization that we were running and you came in 1999.",
      "So Alhamdulillah, it was growing. Then we had our convention in Chicago. That was the big one. Which was about 12,000 people or so. And then after that... 20,000, 40,000. 40, 000, yes. It's a very large number. So you served as president until 2001? Yeah almost. So 9-11 you were President? I was... Sheikh Mohammed Noor became after me. Sheikh Mohammed Abla... He has not taken yet his position.",
      "position. So that fell on your watch? I was there and then this terrible thing happened. Right. The 9-11, I was in Washington at the time. Traveling. Were you there already? Yeah, I wasn't there. And then of course for again a lot of people who probably saw you on television. When then this happened, of course I could not travel so I was grounded my brother's home in Virginia",
      "second day or third day, I received a call from the White House that there will be a prayer service at the National Cathedral. They said would you come and join the President and give a prayer? I said of course it will be an honor. So I went there and had they asked me to make it for more than two minutes",
      "two minutes. It was very nice. I have to say... And then write down everything and they edited it. Oh, it was edited? Took out something at the same time but that was... So as people like us who were living 9-11 and obviously you know the horrors of that day. At there at the time everybody almost everybody there. All the presidents were there. That's what I mean so for us as Muslims now you're seeing from the layperson",
      "from the layperson responding, within days. One it was George Bush's visit to the mosque in Baltimore that I remember and then the prayer service. I don't remember the timeline but these three things happened together all at once that gave majority of us who were living and experiencing the fear of what's going to happen not only for Muslims but just the shock of what had already happened.",
      "were of such comfort and solace to us. And I think I speak to a good chunk of Americans, Muslim Americans when I say this. One was that visit to the mosque in Baltimore. The other was the prayer service where you gave the prayer and you represented the Muslims. And then I think the third would be Laino Sheikh Hamza Yusuf being at the address that the president gave",
      "he was there. And so again, I don't remember the timeline but you know just your words seeing it on ABC First was the prayer Because that was like two days after three days after Tuesday was 9-11 Friday was the Prayer Service Right So that was the first thing that happened And that was around noon time Okay Had the service and then after that immediately I went to the Islamic Center for prayer That was the same day? Same day Oh",
      "and in the prayer service you had a senior push yeah and then also carter and then uh clinton um number of other presidents were there right so i remember that they all i was sitting",
      "to the prayer and like I sit down so senior bush he winked towards me this is good right and uh clinton said like that gave you like a an oh you did it like an okay sign yeah and winking is probably like the texas hello yeah friendly then i after that we went to them",
      "the police room, and there President Bush came. And he shook hands with all of us and said thank us. We expressed our sorrow and sadness. So then I said that after your election we the Muslims wanted very much to meet with you as leaders but this thing happened, could not. So he invited us a week after that.",
      "to the White House and met us there. And so, they were only 15 of us, 15 Muslim leaders from the country. They were there. So Dr. Mahira Tooth was with us and Agha Saeed. Agha Sayed, the late Rahimullah also. Yeah, Rahim Allah and a number of other people. Right. But the people who gathered there",
      "he took few of those, I was inside the Oval Office. So I would be in the Ovil Office and he said you did a heck of a good job. Heck of a Good Prayer. Very George Bush Junior terminology there. Heck Of A Job Brownie after Katrina. Yeah exactly. So i had to take copy of the Quran with me",
      "we gathered, stood up, went close to him and said to him that I'm told by some people that you read Bible every day. He said yes I do. I said well sometime if you like to read Quran also and you see that whatever happened it had nothing to do with the Quran so he said okay. I don't know whether he did or not but he said that",
      "like that and then we were taken to the Roosevelt room. And they were all the other brothers who are from the Muslim community, they were there sitting there. And the whole media was all over. Suddenly they came and he put the Quran in front of him and I was sitting next to him because he asked me to sit next to it. And then he said to the media, the Imam has given me a copy of the Quran.",
      "I think I saw pictures of this event.",
      "national address and we Dr. Sheikh Hamza Yusuf was there, other people. Actually he was going after the prayer service, he was to New York to the Ground Zero. And the media asked me if I would join but I could not make it. I wish I had gone there. So they were thinking that if I go with the president there at the Ground zero. But he invited me after",
      "And for the five years, they had a meeting at the ground zero. Oh, the anniversary of 9-11. I went there. You know, I mean, say what... I think a lot of Muslims who look back at that time, who either were not around or people who were present, I think they react very differently to what happened because people who weren't around during 9-12 and they only read about it and then they see what happened, the wars and so on,",
      "I'm not by any means condoning what George Bush did in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "So, like for those who lived it, you know, there wasn't – yeah. Like there could have been an immediate reaction by the administration to not go out of their way, which is what they did. To go out on their way to make sure that the Muslim community in America felt safe. Like for the president to one of the first orders of business to do a prayer service and then to invite Dr. Muzammar Saddili, for him to visit a major Islamic center in DMV,",
      "in that area, like Detroit, in the D.C. metro area. Those are all big things and like he, like Dr. Siddiqui just said, you know, he held the Quran and said that the Imam gave me this to read and I, you now, that's going out of your way to make sure that the Muslims in America felt safe. And that says a lot. I mean again, not withstanding the wars and everything else George Bush did, foreign policy. Exactly. Because I think that",
      "Because I think that there's a very real chance that had things gone the other way, you know, if it was Trump, who knows, whatever. If somebody else was in office, I think things could have been very different for Muslims in America after 9-11. So, for those of us who lived it. But anyway, as we begin to sort of conclude, first of all, thank you again for your generosity with your time. You're still serving full-time as Imam here at the...",
      "at the Islamic Center of Orange County? Yeah, I'm religious director here. Religious director, okay, mashallah. So what advice, I guess as you've seen this community grow and blossom, me and Omar were just talking about this last night, the tremendous amount of wealth and resources that we now have as a community. We've gone from building Islamic centers to schools",
      "and other, you know now we have registered academic institutions that are certified and recognized by their local state and national bodies whether it's Zaytuna College or Darul Qasim in Chicago just got their accreditation so you've seen the growth of the community so from your perspective what do you see as the challenges sort of going forward Alhamdulillah",
      "love you thank allah and it should be very grateful to allah as well as our community yeah especially a lot of scholars and imams and leaders who have been working and trying to establish good relations with other people",
      "all of this, we have meetings with them. So we should appreciate all this especially our relation and then also your involvement in the government regardless whether we agree with certain policies or we don't but our involvement is very important. We have to participate and see that there is peaceful atmosphere if nobody should do any stupid thing or this horrible thing that happened at 9-11",
      "we have to make sure about that. We have to work together on that and also correcting the image of Islam because a lot of people after 9-11 they associate Islam with terrorism, horrible violence and all those things so Alhamdulillah people have worked very hard on that to bring a better understanding but still we need that.",
      "with wisdom, with understanding. Statements alhamdulillah now people used to say whatever they want to say and the khutbahs and all those things but it is very important for you to watch their words and say the right thing in the right way. Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom with good preaching that we should do. Alhamdulilah most people are doing that",
      "So and this is the what is needed very much our imams Mashallah some of them are excellent highly educated very articulate Imams in different places and more and more al-chahl are coming. This is what they have to do and pay attention to masajid I know it's not easy to stick to someplace but It needs some patience that needs some working with a community right?",
      "very, very important that we should have that. And you know political involvement as well participation in the election. Right local level national level. You have to raise the consciousness of the people bring the right kind of candidates so that we understand them and listen to them. Of course our religious organization cannot endorse any candidate but",
      "who are the people and they're there they are Democrats or we are Republican that is contributions participation involvement helping volunteer work all these people sometimes they think that it's just an election time but action time is not the only time",
      "We should always be involved in that.",
      "capture the stories of people and the giants in our community, and the pioneers of our community whose shoulders we stand on. I keep saying that but you know when you're sitting across someone with someone like Dr. Siddiqui it's hard not to say that because you see here in the presence of the Giants and the Pioneers of our Community so may Allah preserve you give you good health. Mashallah you have four children I want to I don't want to leave without asking about your grandchildren how many grandchildren do you have? Ten grandchildren and one great-grand. Wow!",
      "Wow. There you go. As someone who's the age of our parents, so please remember us and the show and our listeners in your duas. And as always, listeners, thank you for listening. We'll look forward to bringing you more episodes for the rest of the summer. We want to thank Dr. Siddiqui on behalf of me and Omar for joining us and giving us and being so gracious and generous with his time.",
      "of Diffuse Congruence email us at diffusecongruence.gmail.com and also leave us any feedback on iTunes or Twitter and we look forward to catching you on the next episode",
      "It's a beautiful dua that Rasulullah taught to his daughter. And he said, Fatima, don't forget that. You should say this dua morning and evening.",
      "And for those listening, you can translate? Yeah. Oh the Hayyan Qayyum. Ever-living. Known as some people say, Asmala ila Azam. This is the great name of Allah SWT. The only living one, the only one who maintains everything, manages everything. I seek your Rahma. I ask help through your Rahmat.",
      "I correct all my things. And do not leave me to my own resources, even for the twinkling of an eye. MashaAllah. Ameen. Allah bless us. Thank you. Assalamu alaikum."

      "How many must be there? And people who come here, they tolerate each other and want to support each other. Support each other in the matter of righteousness and goodness and do not support anyone in the battle of sin and aggression in the long dream. That is the basic message of Islam.",

      "Dr. Mohamed Mouzamil Siddiqui is the chairman of the Fiqh Council of North America and a member of the Council of Mosques in the United States and Canada. That means he is one of the great intellectual leaders of the Muslim community. He internationally is a member",
      "of the Council of Ulama in Mecca. There are simply no other intellectual voices for the analysis of the morality of nuclear weapons in the Muslim world from a moral and legal perspective. It is great honor to have Dr. Siddiqui address us. Ambassador of Philippines, Lebron Covactlan",
      "the President of GSI, Jonathan Granoff. Distinguished panelists, ambassadors, your excellencies, your honors. It's an honor to be here. My organization, Fiqh Council of North America, the Muslim Jewish Council of north America as well as the Islamic Society of North",
      "on this issue of nuclear disarmament. About 10 years ago, we had a meeting with the Church's Center for Theology and Public Policy, and we published a full report on that. Various papers were presented. I want to reemphasize the Islamic position on nuclear armaments. Nuclear weapons pose",
      "danger to all humanity. There is certainly a great need that various ethical traditions, whether religious or humanitarian work together to remove this danger from the world. Islam teaches that God is the creator master and owner of everything in this world. All human beings are one family. Human beings must honor each other",
      "and should live in peace and do justice to each other. God has given this earth, and all its resources as a trust to human being. It is the duty of the human beings to use them carefully not to misuse them or waste them. The aggression or injustice of course should be removed but should be remove by proper means.",
      "War must be a limited enterprise. It should be avoided as much as possible, and it should be limited only against the aggressors. There are specific rules in Islam about who should declare war, when to wage war, and how to conduct warfare, very similar to the just-war theory in Judaism, Christianity, and other traditions. I would not go into any detail about that, but I just want to say",
      "I want to say that nuclear weapons do not come anywhere in the concept of just war. It is just war, there's no justice in it. Nuclear weapons are by nature weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear Weapons make no distinction between combatants and non-combatants. They cause permanent damage to environment.",
      "also. They are not proportionate responses to any conventional attack. Nuclear weapons destroy human animal life, affect and destroy the lives of future generations by causing diseases and infections. And there are many other problems with these weapons. These weapons are very expensive",
      "is spent about $90 million every day on maintaining these weapons. There are always a possibility of human and technical error that may cause nuclear disaster, they can fall in the hands of rogue elements in the military using such weapons, and they may fall into the hands militants or terrorist groups. It is possible that a conventional war may quickly escalate into a nuclear war. These weapons are dangerous also",
      "also for those who own them. WMD are also known as MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction. Accidents or natural disasters such as earthquake or tsunami may also bring nuclear disasters. Because of these and many others it is absolutely forbidden according to Islamic legal tradition",
      "nuclear weapons. The Sharia, the ethical and moral law of Islam absolutely prohibit the development of such destructive weapons to hold that there should be a universal ban on the development possession and deployment of these weapons. There is no legal or moral criteria to permit some states to maintain",
      "then there will always be an incentive for others to have them. Islamic law recognizes the doctrine of deterrence in war. Nations are allowed to have forces and weapons that can deter their enemies to attack them. However, the argument for nuclear deterrence will remain as long as some nations have these weapons. If all nations agree to get rid of these weapons",
      "There will be no need for nuclear deterrence. Complete nuclear disarmament is the most appropriate way to achieve nuclear deterrents. The honest and fair position should be to eliminate these weapons. There is no justification for some to have, and others to be denied. These weapons should be delegitimized, and should not be used as a threat. There should be a universal ban on these weapons",
      "All countries should be respected without any exception. Thank you."

      "safety and salvation from the hellfire. Ramadan, our Prophet peace be upon him said that an angel of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala calls every night every night there is a call from an angel who announces",
      "O the seeker of goodness, come forward. And O the seeker of evil, stop, desist. The doors of heaven are open, our Prophet said. The door of heaven is open and the shayateen are put in chains. So it's easy to do good things especially in the month of Ramadan.",
      "of Ramadan and we should take full advantage of this time beside fasting every day beside our regular prayers and our nightly prayers let us also increase the zikr of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala remember us of Allah",
      "Recite the Quran more often and do Istighfar. Seek Allah's forgiveness. Special time for istighfar is early morning time. Allah says in the Quran,",
      "And that time is before the Fajr time. That is a time when people pray tahajjud prayer and then make dua'a, and ask Allah's forgiveness. Allah opens His arms, of course only Allah knows the nature of His arms. He opens His arm and says, Is there anyone who come and ask me forgiveness? I forgive him.",
      "So Allah is willing to accept. Now it's not, I mean many people do that but it is not easy for everyone to get up at that time an hour before dawn and have the tahajjud prayer and dhikr of Allah. Some people do it but most people don't do it. But especially in the month of Ramadan because of sahoor",
      "because we have to take pre-run meal, we are up. Most of the people get up at that time. So it is good to use that time beside you having your Suhoor meal. Take this opportunity to spend few minutes in making a special Dua. Making a special Istighfar. And inshallah you will receive the reward for that. You will receive",
      "So make use of this time. I want to suggest you that everyday make a habit everyday get up early and spend at least 10 minutes. You make your wudu, then after that if you have time pray 2 raka or more if you've more time. And this is your tahajjud prayer.",
      "Sit down and make dua. Make istighfar. And do that every day. So you recite surat al-Fatiha, and then make some dua. Or you recite ayatul kursi and make du'a. Ask Allah SWT to accept your fast. Ask",
      "all the difficulties and problems that you or your family may face, may be facing. And problems from humanity, from Ummah. Pray for everybody and seek Astaghfirullah. Astagfirullah, Astagfirlillah, Astaghfirlallah. And do it regularly, every day.",
      "your family close it with and this will be a very appropriate dua salat and salaam on the prophet when you do that allah swt loves that and then allah will accept all your dua",
      "So this is a great time for dua, this is the great time of istighfar and let us not miss that. Especially when we are up already in the month of Ramadan take benefit of that. May Allah bless you. Make this dua and remember me also in your dua. BarakaAllah fikum. Wassalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh"

      "مبارک ثابت فرمائے اور ہمیں اس سے پورا فائدہ اٹھانے کی توفیق عطا فرمائے رمضان بڑا مبالک مہینہ ہے بڈی عظمت والا مہينہ ہے اللہ کی رحمتوں کا نزول ہوتا ہے اس مہنے میں رحمתوں کے دروازے کھل جاتے ہیں جنتوں کے",
      "جکڑ دیا جاتے ہیں یہ نیکیوں کا مہینہ ہے یہ نیقیوں کی موسم بہار ہے اللہ کے مومن بندے امان والے بندیں جب رمضان آتا ہے تو ان کے دلوں میں خوشیوں کے لحر دور جاتی ہے بہت برکت کا مهینہ",
      "وہ مہینے ہے جس میں ہر رات اللہ کا ایک فرشتہ آکے منادی کرتا ہے دنیا والوں کے لئے۔",
      "ہم اللہ کا شکر گزار ہیں کہ اس نے ہمیں پھر اپنی زندگی میں یہ موقع دیا کہ ہم رمضان کو دیکھیں اور رماضان سے فائدہ اٹھائیں الحمدللہ ہم",
      "ہمیں شکر اور زیادہ بھی ادا کرنا چاہئے کیونکہ گزشتہ سال رمضان کے مہینے میں ہمارے وائرس کے وجہ سے زندگی معطل تھی بہت سارے چیزیں رکوئی ہوئی تھیں مساجد بند کر دی گئی تھی نہ جماعت نہ جمعہ رماضان کے اجتماعات گیذرنگ",
      "کہ نمازیں قرآن کی تلاوت یہ ساری آوازیں جو آتی تھیں مسجدوں میں جو اجتماع ہوتے تھے سب رک گئے تھیں لوگ ڈاؤن ہم لوگ نے نماذیں پڑھیں الحمدللہ تراوی پڈھی اپنے گھروں میں روزے رکھے لیکن ایک ویرانی سے محسوس ہوتی تھی ایک عجیب سمجھ ہوتا تھا دل کے اندر کہ کاش ہم مسجד میں ہوتیں کاش معلوموں کے ساتھ ہونے",
      "تو اللہ کا شکر ہے کہ یہ سیچوئیشن پورے سال رہی اللہ کے شکریہ کہ اب حالات بہتر ہو رہے ہیں وائرس موجود ہے اور ہمیں احتیاط کرنی چاہیے پوری لیکن پھر بھی حالت بہ تر ہیں اور مساجد کھل گئی ہیں اور انشاءاللہ لمازیں ہوں گی تراویح ہوگی اللطف قبول فرمائے",
      "ایمان والو روزہ تمہارے پر فرض کیا گیا ہے",
      "جس طرح کہ فرض کیا گیا تھا ان لوگوں پر جو تم سے پہلے گزرے ہیں تاکہ تم تقوی سیکھ سکو تو یہ روضہ بہت زمانے سے جلا رہا ہے صدیوں سے ہزاروں سالوں سے تمام انبیاء اللہ تعالیٰ کے اپنی عمتوں کو تلخین کرتے تھے بتاتے تھे کہ وہ رواضہ رکھیں اور",
      "اور کسی نہ کسے طریقے کا روزہ لوگوں میں تھا لیکن امتیں بھول گئیں اس کو یہاں تک کہ اللہ کے آخری رسول محمد صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم آئے اور آپ نے پھر اس احیا کیا اس روایت کا روجہ رکھنے کا اپنے جناح کیا",
      "میں یہ نہیں کہتا کہ اور لوگوں کے ہیں روزہ نہیں ہے، ہے روضہ لیکن اتنی پابندی نہیں ہے۔ الحمدللہ مسلمان روظہ رکھتے ہیں اور اسی طرح رکھی جس طرحت رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے روثہ رچھا۔",
      "جب بھی روزہ رکھیں انشاءاللہ اس کا ثواب ملے گا اس کا فائدہ ہوگا روضہ جو ہے وہ تقویٰ کا سکول ہیں روڈہ سکھاتا ہے انسان کو تقوا اور تقوع یہ ہے کہ انسάν کے اندر پرحزگاری ہو نیکیوں کی طرف رغبت ہو اور براہیوں سے بچنے کی فکر ہو حضرت عبداللٰہ بن مسعود رضی اللہ عنہ نے فرماتے تھے",

      "روزہ رکھتے ہیں رمضان میں اس کی وجہ یہ ہے کہ قرآن اور رماضان دوروں میں بڑا ربط ہے روضے اور وحی الہی میں برا ربٹ ہے موسیٰ علیہ السلام رو ضے کے حالت میں تھے جب ان کے اوپر کوہ سینہ پر تورات نازل کی گئی عیسیٱ علیه السلام",

      "یہ حق و باطل میں فرق کرنا تو تم میں سے جو بھی سفر پر نہیں ہے یعنی موجود ہے اپنے گھر پہ اور وہ دیکھیں اس مہینے کو تو وہ روزہ رکھے اس میں تو رمضان کے روضے فرض ہیں اللہ تعالیٰ نے ان کو فرض کیا ہے اور ہر مسلمان کو چاہیئے کہ وہ رروضہ ركھے آقل و بالغ",
      "روضہ فرض ہے الا یہ کہ وہ مریض ہو یا سفر پر جو بھی بیمار ہیں یا صفر کرے اور کسی وقت پر مگر رمضان کے مہینے میں بغیر کس اذر کے روزہ چھوڑنا بہت بڑا گناہ ہے آدمی قضاء کر سکتا ہے مگرا اس کا جو مکمل تلافی نہیں ہوسکتی",
      "جو مکمل ثواب ہے اس کا عجر ہے اس کی جو عظمت ہے اس کو آدمی حاصل نہیں کر سکتا اگر اس نے بغیر کسی عذر کے رمضان کے روزہ کو چھوڑ دیا تو بہت احتیاط کریں پوری کوشش کرنی چاہئے کہ ہم روضہ رکھیں اور",
      "محسوس نہ کریں بلکہ یہ دیکھیں کہ اللہ تعالی ہمیں ہدایت دے بلقا صبح کو جب آپ نیت کریں تو یہ کہیں اللہم انی نوائی تو بصوم اليوم میں نیات کرتا ہوں آج کے روزے کی اللہما یسر حولی و تقبل امنی واللہ اس کو آسان کردے میرے لئے اور قبول فرماؤں مجھ سے سو نیعت کے ساتھ اخلاق کے سادھ اللہ کے خاطر آپ روضہ رکھیں تو انشاءاللہ آپ کو اس سے فائدہ ہو",

      "There is anyone that I call him my teacher all the time, a mentor all the times and my leader all the Time. And the person that I learned from him nearly also on weekly basis or maybe daily basis was Dr. Muzamil Sudeqi. I was doing Umrah in 1981. Many of you were not born by that time.",
      "وفي المدينة التي تقع فيها هو الرئيس والإمام للجماعة الإسلامية في مدينه الأزرق عندما جاء، كانت ليست فقط أبهبلًا لكن حكومته في كاليفورنيا السودانية. صديقي صحيحًا، جعلت الجماعة الأزراقية العالمية أكبر جماعة إسلاميًا في البلد، في كل مدن أمريكا",
      "His presence is felt everywhere. He started the first one here in California to start a radio program for Islam and Muslims, you know? And then he started teaching around, you now. My office was in Orange County by then. Sometimes I go to pray with him. Every time I listen to his khutbah, I get something new. Actually on February 6th,",
      "في عام 2006، 1981، كان لدينا مقابلة للإناغراطية للسلاميين من سوريا. ومن يأتي هو صدقي المؤكد أنه لا أحد آخر إلا د. صديقي. كان أيضاً يتواجد بشخص جيد مني، د. ماير حاتحود في ذلك اليوم، ود. رحمة صاربونزي، ولكن أعتقد أن د. سليمان شاخدين شاهيمان ودكتور جماع البداوي",

      "and all around the world. Ameen",
      "And around it, especially in the valley of Arafat, more than two million people, around two million gathered declaring their faith in Allah. Declaring that they are there at the call of Allah. They were repeating",
      "And today they are in Mina. They have performed other rituals and they are saying Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar as we say. Allahu Akbar La ilaha illa Allah Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar wa li'l-Lahi alhamd Talbiya and Takbirat are reminders to us who we are what is the purpose of our life? What is the message of Islam?",

      "And that is what every Muslim individually, male or female, young or old, every Muslim has to say that. My commitment is to Allah. Before coming to prayer I met a sister at the Feast of Sacrifice. We remember the sacrifice of Ibrahim with willingness to sacrifice more than 4000 years ago.",
      "more than four thousand years ago and he was ready to sacrifice his only son at that time. And that was Ismail. He was willing to sacrifice, at the command of Allah. And he saw and said to his son, my dear son Ya Gunayy, I have seen in my dream that I am sacrificing you",
      "and the Prophet's dreams are true. So that is command of Allah. And the son realized that, son grew up in a prophetic home. The tarbiyah was good. He was raised with Iman, faith in Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala. When his father said it, when the prophet of Allah said my son I have seen my dream",
      "then I am sacrificing you. He said, My father, my dear father, do what you are told. Do what you're commanded and you will find me very patient. And so both of them submitted. The call came from Allah SWT. Ya Ibrahimu qad sadaqta ar-ru'ya. Ibrahim, you fulfilled. You fulfilled the command.",
      "the command finish you have done your job the command is then we accepted that we accept your faith your commitment your loyalty your obedience and will give you the reward for that",

      "And this is the feast of sacrifice. Muslims all over the world, more than 2 billion Muslims all around the world are celebrating the sacrifice of animals. Sacrifice is our faith, our commitment, our loyalty to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that we are willing to do everything for the cause of Allah. Our persons and our possessions",

Not your own self, not your own desires, not you own wishes. Allahu Akbar! When you say Allahu Akbar everything is bigger than Allah.",
      "Allah is bigger than your own self. Allah is greater than your desires. Allah Is bigger than you job, than your money, everything else. Allah's bigger than that. To keep Allah as great, Kabir! Kabir means declare the greatness of Allah. That's our Takbir. Sacrifice is to help the poor and the needy",
      "Self, not just own yourself. Sacrifice your greed. Sacrifice your selfishness, materialism, egotism, race, color, all of these things. Stand up beyond that and do it for the sake of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. That is what Iman requires my brothers and sisters. Just like Ibrahim alayhi salam, like Ismail alayhis salaam",
      "like Muhammad, Eid al-Adha connects us with the Kaaba, with the Prophets of Allah, with The Messengers of Allah and with the people in need. But they are not doing it in the way that should be done. If they do it that way, if they are united, work together, follow the Messenger of Rasulullah",

      "previously odious to Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala that you say something which you do not do. So action, action is very important but I want to emphasize today what makes an action Islamic action? An action is not Islamic simply because a Muslim does it or some Muslims do it or maybe a large number of Muslims do",
      "It does not become Islamic simply because some Muslims are doing it. It has certain rules and those rules have to be applied, and by those rules we can recognize that the action is Islamic or not Islamic. So the action has to be right action and good action",
      "and I want to emphasize both right action and good action. Right means that it is according to the Quran and the Sunnah if somebody goes against the Quran in the Sunna and not approved by the Quran of the Sunnat then of course it is not right but also has to be done in a nice manner, in an appropriate manner sometimes people do right thing",

      "done a specks weight of good things will see it and whosoever has done in aspects weight of evil we'll see it so whatever is with a very small amount or big amount good or D or bad all of them are recorded in the record of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and it should be shown on that day",

      "reward for that and to your Lord is the ultimate return one nail a pickle Munda now it is when we say do good deeds I'm El Salah very often people think I'm Al Salaam is only prayers acts of devotion Salad Siam the cat had or few others",
      "They think that this is what the good deeds are But actually good deals in Islam Everything that you do if you do it in the right way It is Islamic. It is religious because Islam Distinguishes of course between the Ibadah and between business Between other activities, but at the same time",
      "way if you do it in the right way you will receive the reward for that so you will achieve the reward if you're doing business you'll see the reward of food you will see the rewards from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala if you study in the night and you have sports in the light whatever thing what about the",

      "in Allah you hurt boys are amela a hadouken Amala and youth Kena very beautiful very powerful Hadith emphasizing the right thing what is the Islamic concept of good deeds what is this Lamy concept of righteous action I shall do the lot Alana says that man was passing by the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam sahaba looked at him",
      "His enthusiasm the way he was going and what the way. He was acting they saw his Jelad when I shot The person was very active Whatever we were doing So they said yeah, Rasulallah if this kind of zeal and this kind effort was in the path of Allah Thinking jihad if you are then doing that What nice thing it would have been if he was doing that? the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said",

      "What is the sabila? Do things in the halal way, in the right way, for a good purpose and cause. And of course keep your balance between your duties as we call them hukouq. Hukouqu Allah, hukoul ibad and hukokul ashya. Hukuqullah are that your duty towards Allah, between you and Allah. This is very important. That your prayers, your fasting",
      "zakat your Hedge all the other religious obligations you do them that is of course who cool ah and then also cool about the duties towards other human beings especially to your parents your spouse to your children",
      "so there are various people in your circle of relationship taking good care of them being good to them that is also feasible Allah and that is a good deed that you have to do that and then also being good too the animals being",
      "so don't pollute those things, don't waste those things. Don't corrupt the environment. This is also part of religious deeds. So the concept of religious deed in Islam is a very wide concept and it is important that people pay attention to this. And this is something you should do continuously",
      "in seeing the desert yourself. Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, If the last hour comes and one of you is going to plant a dead palm tree",

Now you can imagine the last hour is coming and if you are going to plant, you will not see the result. The world is going to come to an end because it takes five six years for a palm tree to develop and grow and bear fruit",
      "But Rasulullah said, do that. Don't get up. Continue and plant. You will receive the reward for that. So reward is for doing the right good, right action, good action. That's the reward. So what is important in understanding what is Islamic work? What is Islamic thing? Because there's a lot of propaganda against Islam",
      "And some also, also Muslims have misconception. People think whatever Muslim do is Islam. So a lot of wrong things they see happening in the Muslim world by some Muslims and its name is given Islamic, Islamic. Some people arrange and organize themselves and they call their area Islamic state so that become Islamic state",
      "Islamic state in there's totally an Islamic some people to behave in a wrong way come do the acts of violence called Islamic violence Islamic terrorism so Islamophobes are using that and some Muslim think that also so it is important to understand that they are certain principles certain rules that have to be observed then I think will be Islamic not simply because somebody who belong",
      "between what is religious and what is not religious. So do anything that is good, all things that are good you do that including of course your prayers, your fasting, your devotion, all of these things but beside that you also do many other things that beneficial for yourself as well as others. And the third thing is every good deed is valuable whether you may see the fruit or not.",
      "Muslims do not work only to see the results here in this world our goal is that our deeds are accepted in the Hereafter and the reward comes from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala ultimately and the deist must be righteous right yes means approved by Allah subhana wata'ala",
      "all deeds should be done with sincerity so it's not for show off it's to have publicity the thing is do it for the sake of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala make your intention sincere",
      "good for all so promoting the good is right here section and also negating and eliminating the evil is also right here a section when it's called umbril Maru that is called lay in him unka commanding what is right enjoining what is light and forbidding what is wrong to stopping",
      "The famous hadith of the Prophet, if you see some evil stop it by your hand. Take action to stop it. If you cannot they speak against it.",
      "you cannot say it then at least don't accept it in your heart feel that this is wrong in your hearts you can say that this and as soon as I have the opportunity I will do that to correct it to remove it but that is the problem that is a weaker situation that is",
      "that the righteous actions are those that are done with knowledge wisdom planning and persistence and there is part of a Hassan and it's on that you have to know that what you are doing you must know use wisdom and your patience and persistence sometime small act if it is then persistently regularly",
      "it will succeed. A small effort succeeds if it is done in the proper manner. And then also, righteous actions are those actions whereby you fulfill the haqquq as we mentioned before. We must keep in mind priorities. There are certain things that are fardh, some things are sunnah, some",
      "يجب أن نفل بعض الأشياء ويكون بعضها مكروه",
      "Somebody is neglecting that. Allah has put certain obligations upon you, do not neglect them. Do not ignore them. So one has to understand this categorization, these categories of good deeds. Some of them are fardh, some of them",
      "The objective of the Sharia Objectives not simply the work act for the sake of act but what is the objective and our have identified the maqasid of all Islamic rules, and they are mentioned there five of my classes one of them is protection of life The second day the production of property the third is the production honor or family and the fourth is the protection of",
      "production of honor and then family, and the fifth one of course your religion. So these are the major maqasid recognized identified by great scholars like Imam Ghazali, Imam Juwaini and others so those maqa'sids should be remembered and another aspect is that remember the Ma'alat",
      "Maalat means and they call it fiqh al-ma'alat. It is a fiqah, it's the kind of understanding of the law of Islam. Understand what is going to happen if I do that? What will be the consequences of my action? And you have to understand that, consequences of action when you say something or you do something think about it how is going affect? What is going",
      "Those who believe and do the good deeds, we shall not waste the reward of those who do good deeds. Those who do nicely their good deeds In the same surah, Suratul Kahf ends with that",
      "Conclusion of the great Surah, Surat Al-Kahf that we recite.",
      "Many of us recite on Fridays and it has great stories. Stories of the people who are doing the work of devotion, people of Kahaf they suffered for that but they did it in the right way. The story of patience that Musa learned in the company of Khidr. The story",
      "help the poor and the needy you have that any story of the people the people of the two garden who had the wealth who had poverty one of them did not use that in the right way did not help the poorer an idiot so lost everything so all these stories remind what is the proper action and how the action should be taken we pray to Allah",

      "Doing that to the Western people, they are using it against Europeans. This is not like Afghanistan. This isn't Iraq. This and this and this aren't there. Those uncivilized people, those people who are not white, this happened here. So it means bombing in those areas, killing those people, that's okay. But bombing European? Europeans bombing Europeans? White people bombing whites? This is kind of racism.",

Only Allah knows whether you are fasting or not fasting, you know and Allah knows so it is between You and Allah and that is Taqwa, that is the ultimate Taqwah to fast trains us for that makes us sincere to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala do things for the sake of Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la",

      "the bad deeds that's that the training for that give up I think the bed was no backbiting no lying and cheating no fighting none of these things keep away from all those things then feel fast becomes a real fast intention to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala Allah subhana wata'ala and maintaining a discipline so this is",

Prepare your time, organize your time from your work, from your job, from business all those things you see I'm going to spend more time in this month reading the Quran because it's a month of Quran",

Baca Al-Quran, memutuskan, rancang bahawa anda akan selesai sepanjang Al-Kur'an pada bulan ini oleh bacaan peribadi anda sendiri dan kemudian datang kepada tarawih berdoa dan dengar Al-quran. Tarawih adalah doa istimewa untuk bandar Ramadan. Jadi buat keputusan yang saya akan datang untuk doa tarawif. Walaupun doa terawih, anda boleh lakukan sendiri, anda dapat melakukannya di rumah.",
      "home it's not obligatory to do it in the masjid but it is good to be with jama'ah, a group of people. Sahaba used to gather after the Prophet left there were various readers of the Quran who would have a gathering few people come here and some will come here in the Masjid of the Prophet different groups were praying and then so Umar passed by",

Dan ia adalah sunnah besar. Alaikum bi sunnatin wa sunnati al khulafahi rasyidin dan sahabatan setuju dengan itu dan selepas itu selalu ada seseorang yang ditandakan untuk menjadikan doa",

Dan tentu saja anda harus datang lebih lama lagi dan melakukan beberapa qiyam pada malam, doa tahajud terutama dalam Ramadan sama ada anda boleh berdoakan 8 rakah atau anda berdoak 2 rakah, bahkan 2 rakh tetapi berdoain sesuatu dan kemudian anda mendapat sahur",
      "berakah, iaitu baraka dalam makanan itu. Berakah secara fizikal tentu saja kerana anda makan sesuatu yang lainnya anda akan sangat lapar jadi makan sesuaikannya dan kemudian berakah datang dari rahmat Allah SWT kerana Anda mengikut perintah. Makan apabila Allah SWt memberitahu anda untuk makan dan hentikan apabilAllaah memberitahukan anda untuk berhenti. Jadi ini adalah disiplin yang anda lakukan. Jadi persiapan dan perkara lain yang harus anda persiapkan juga pada bulan Ramadan",
      "kerana bulan Ramadhan adalah bulan berlalu, bulan sabar tetapi juga ini adalah masa amal. Ini adalah waktu untuk memberi, memberikan untuk syaitan Allah. Ia masanya untuk memberikan sadaqah. Ialah masa untuk memberikannya khairat. Ianya masanya bagi zakat. Beberapa orang mereka mengira ada zakat dari Ramadan ke Ramadan walaupun anda tidak perlu melakukannya",
      "anda boleh melakukannya pada masa-masa yang sesuai tetapi ia baik jika anda melakunya dalam Ramadan, anda dapat menerima penghargaan dua kali penghargian memberikan zakat dan berikannya pada waktu yang baik ketika perbuatan diberi oleh Allah SWT jadi berikan zakah mengurangkannya dengan betul kemudian berikan kepada mereka yang memerlukan orang yang melepasi untuk memberikan Zakat harus diberikan Alhamdulillah di masyarakat Islam kita mendapatkan",
      "kita menerima zakat dan memasukkannya secara berbeza. Jangan campur dengan harga masjid. Tetapi kami juga minta untuk memberikan kepada masjids. Ini adalah masa yang baik untuk memberikannya sebagai sadaqah, pembawaan, amal untuk organisasi anda, institusi anda untuk memberi itu. Jadi ada program khusus, program penghantaran khususan telah dilakukan untuknya. Jadi bawa orang-orang bersama insyaAllah dan bergabung untuk organisatif anda,",
      "jadi sadaqah, amal. Anda tahu ada dua jenis amalan yang dikaitkan dalam Islam, amalan apabila anda memberikan kepada orang miskin dan penyakit dan itu disebut zakat dan sadaka tetapi kemudian terdapat amalan infa'afi sabili Allah infa-afi Sabili Allah adalah memberikan amalan kepada institusi untuk membangun masyarakat anda untuk membina organisasi anda berikannya kerana tujuan Allah SWT",
      "So it's a month of charity. It is the month of Sadaqah and the reward is great, inshallah. So we pray to Allah SWT to make the month Ramadan a good month for us, inshaAllah. And of course you will hear more and more reminders about that. But people start from Sha'ban talking about Ramadan. Actually in some of the hadiths we learned that Prophet used to remind people from Rajab",

We'll be doing a smaller box dinner format. You're welcome to take the box dinners back home or join us over here in the confidence room of the cafeteria inshallah on those two nights. Wednesday through Sunday, we'll have the community dinners out on the Lawn. We will be serving the tables as well inshAllah Wednesday through sunday.",
      "Sunday. Now the biggest change this Ramadan is that we are requiring registration for all iftars. Now brothers and sisters what has happened in the past is uh, we'll be in the room in the back trying to figure out how much food to order and so we order set for 700. 500 people show up for the iftar and now we're stuck with food for 200 people. We give out,",
      "seen last year, so much of our food ends up in the trash from the community, from the boxes and the tables and so on. I can't stand this and I know you can't either. So you're going to help us out this year. We'll register inshallah for each iftar and just let us know that you're coming. That way we can order food for you and make sure that it's fresh and available that night. We will manage our budget. We have zero waste and inshAllah Allah bless us in that decision. The second thing, I don't",
      "We generally offer 20,000 iftars and this will flex up this year mashallah because the community is growing. And so in that we're asking for your donations and your support. Mashallah each iftar costs quite a bit and every single year our costs are going up. We have the QR code up here and we're encouraging you inshallah to visit the accounting office to speak with Sister Michelle and Brother Munir to organize your donation. You can pick up the 27th night",
      "at least one every single weekend. The other big change that we're making this year is Alhamdulillah our focus on maximizing ibadah so we're going to limit the number of vendors that we have on campus during Taraweeh, we're limiting actually the number things that happen around campus during taraweeh We want everybody to be inside the masjid worshipping Allah SWT after taraweeheh we might have a Ramadan market on a night or two insha'Allah",

      "And so we should be afraid of that. That is, we should not receive the punishment of Allah. That's why every day in our Dua Qunut which is a last prayer of the day In this we make a dua and this is a dua of humbleness great devotion We say",

      "It's possible that sometime you dislike something it is good for you and it's possible, that sometimes you like something and it is not good for You. And Allah knows then you do not know So in our present situation In this widespread pandemic",
      "people millions and million people have been affected and thousands are dying it is this is the time of both fear and hope the fear means that you should be cautious careful and take your all the precautions that are needed and but at the same time don't panic at the",
      "will remove this trouble from us inshallah and those who die if they grow with iman with the faith in allah subhanahu wa ta'ala Allah will bless them and give them the place in Jannah so it is hope and fear both at the same time and there has to be one should be realistic one should very realistic in doing things",
      "And there is another thing called wish. And third thing people call it, is stupidity. So that is hope. Hope means you do your best, make a effort and then you hope that you will succeed. You will achieve your aim, your goal. So let's hope. Wish is, you don't do much but you wish. Sometimes there's reason, sometimes no reason",
      "sometimes you don't reason, but you wish it. But foolishness is that do something opposite, something wrong and then hope that you will succeed. Just like a student work very hard, pay attention to his studies, the homework, all of these things, and then he'll hope for having good grades and succeed. So that's hope. A farmer",
      "Work hard, till the ground, put the seed. Water is ground and all this thing. And hope that you'll have a good crop. But if somebody's not doing anything or somebody's totally ignoring, a student who's totally ignoring his studies doesn't go to class, doesn't watch any... Spend all the time playing and then doing wrong things? And then says that I'll get good results. That is called humility.",
      "That is called Himaqa, that's called Safaha. That is stupidity. It's not going to work that way. In a similar way Muslims have challenges. If they ignore those challenges don't do anything well they are not going succeed. They're going to have all the failures one after another and if we are together organize themselves bring together of himself and make effort then they will get success inshallah",
      "It is not up to your wishes. It is Not up to the wishes of the people of the book Christians and Jews Whosoever does something bad will see the result Huge is Abih, and he will not find any helper against Allah",
      "against allah and whosoever does something righteous good male or female with belief in allah subhanahu wa ta'ala who moment and the person is a believer those are the people who will go to jannah so they will find a place in jannah and they will not be denied a bit of anything good they have done unless one that will give them the reward for that",
      "All of us that we should have We should do right things good things a white sin and inshallah Allah Subhanaw Taala will bless Allah Subhaan Taala give the reward for that and Everybody would make an effort because all human beings are have shortcomings mistakes And the shortcomings and mistakes will be forgiven as long as there is faith in Allah subhana wa ta'ala As long as they did afford to do the right thing",
      "So it is important that one should be thankful to Allah, grateful to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Whatever good we have, we try to benefit from that. Have you not seen some people who had the blessings of Allah subhana wa ta-ala but they were ungrateful and so they brought themselves and their people to the destruction, to the problems?",
      "Prophets of Allah used to remind people again and again that be aware of Allah, and be conscious of Allah. You know great Prophet Shu'aib was sent to a people who were businesspeople And they were doing quite good in their business They were successful business people But not honest in their businesses. They used to do a lot of fraud So prophet said to them",
      "I see that you are all right. You're doing well. But I fear that you will have punishment. Why? Because they were making fraud. Do not cheat people in the measurement as well as in the weight. So, they were doing cheating and apparently at that time they were okay.",
      "time they were okay but the prophet looked beyond that yes you look in the Iraq you look nice you look okay but I this cheating these wrongdoings are going to have a effect so things have their consequences and the consequences come so that's why everybody has to be aware of that",
      "explained by our scholars that this is hope so they have hope and raja in their dua",
      "O Allah, I seek your rahmah and I fear your azab. And do not leave us, do not abandon us to our own efforts and make all of our affairs good. There is no God except you.",
      "Somebody said very nicely, he said that when you write your will, you know"

Alhamdulillah, we fulfilled the command that Allah told us to do. And also at the same time, food, drink, whatever was there,",
      "اس کے ساتھ رمضان میں ایک خاص محبت ہے۔ آپ 15 دنوں کو پہلے گا، 16 دن اور بعد سے آپ کو یہ مزید محسوس کی مرکزی کا نظام ہوتا ہے۔ اور کچھ بھی آپ کے لئے ہیں ، تفصیل واسٹس اور جو بھی مجھے محقوق ہے ، وہ اپنا خوبصورت محل ہے اور آپ انگیز کریں گے۔ اللہ سبحانہ وتعالیٰ کا عطا فرمائے",

      "Abu Umama al-Bahili says that a man came to the Prophet and he said, Ya Rasulullah what is Iman? What is faith? And the Prophet said when your good deed make you happy and your bad deed make",
      "Maka anda adalah seorang pembeli. Ini ialah tanda iman. Kemudian dia bertanya kepada Rasulullah, apa itu kesal? Dan Rasul Allah s.a.w. berkata, jika sesuatu membuat anda terlalu marah di dalam, maka tinggalkannya. Jika anda tidak yakin sama ada ia betul atau salah, tinggalnya. Jikalau anda merasa bersyukur tentang sesuapun dan anda rasa takut di dalamnya, hanyalah yang harus dilakukan. Anda merasakan kecelakaan. Lepas itu Rasul S.a s. w. mengatakan, fada'uhu, makin tinggikannya.",
      "So that is the sign of Iman. That is the Sign of Happiness, that one is following the right path of Allah. Good deed make you happy. When you pray, you feel happy. when you fast, you will be happy.",
      "family, treating people nicely, speaking the truth being honest feel happy. Alhamdulillah good things make you happy and at the same time when you mistreat somebody when you refuse to help somebody whom you can't help you feel something inside pain inside why I did that? Why I did not do that? Somebody asks you something and you don't respond well then you see that",
      "Why I did that? And then you have this grief. Then you realize that it's what harm going to answer my Lord on the day of judgment. So, you repent and you say, I'm not going to do that again. I'll correct myself. I improve myself. And that is the way, that is behavior of the believers. So iman requires that. Iman requires that we should always improve ourselves, make up",
      "ہمارے لئے اپنی خود کو بہتر کرنا ہے۔ مجھے اس کے ساتھ فشل کی دوران، تدریب اور قسمت نے ہمیں دیا گیا۔ وہ سال میں ہم سوچا تھا کہ ہم انسانوں کا حکومت کریں گے۔ مطابق ، مجزین محفوظیت اور اللہ تعالیٰ کے نصرے سے مضادہ دائیں گی۔ اللہ سبحانہ وتعالی اور اس پروفیٹ اور مسنجر اور یہ چیز پر اپنا رواستہ اگلابی بنانا جاتا ہے۔",
      "There are two mistakes that people do about fasting and the month of Ramadan. One is, people think fasting is just a physical act. Fasting means you don't eat or drink, or do other things that are forbidden during fasting. Some physical act, but don't do that. Yes, fasting is a physical",
      "It is a moral act. It is control of oneself, discipline of oneself. It's moving towards doing the right things. So fasting is not just avoiding food and drink. The Prophet said, If someone does not give up the bad deeds,",
      "ایک بہترین عملات اور کامیاب اللہ کو اس کھانا اور دنیا سے نہیں ملے گا۔",
      "People who stand up for nightly prayers, not get anything except tired. Wakefulness and sleep. May Allah save us from that. That our fasting should be not only just avoiding food and drink, our standing in prayer is not just standing and bobbing and moving but something that changes inside. And this inside change is the reality",
      "Kita harus teruskan setelah Ramadhan. Bukan hanya di dalam Ramadan, tetapi juga selepas itu. Teruskan melakukan perkara yang betul dan ia akan membuat peribadi kita berkembang. Dan kita perlu teruskan dari Ramadhaan ke Ramadan pada hari-hari. Jadi hidup kita akan terus tumbuh menjadi lebih baik sehingga kita mencapai syurga insyaAllah. Sehingga kami mencapainya oleh Tuhan dan dia akan menguasakan kita dengan terima kasihnya.",
      "The second thing that I mentioned, one aspect of fasting is to consider fasting as a physical act. Another thing is thinking that Ramadan is a very nice month, great month, blessed month but as soon as the Ramadan is over it's not Ramadan anymore. Why do we have to do that?",
      "Jadi kita berubah diri. Tetapi itu bukan tujuan Ramadhan. Ramadhaan adalah anda membuat diri lebih baik dan kemudian anda teruskan, pada Ramadhanya seterusnya akan menemukan diri yang lebih baik. Ramadaan ini lebih baik daripada Ramadhana sebelumnya. Ramadan seterusannya lebih baik dari Ramadhanda ini. Seperti yang disebutkan oleh Ali Razaltan tentang setiap hari dia mengatakan begitu. Dia kata",
      "The person whose two days are the same is a loser. That means his day, yesterday's must be better than yesterday and tomorrow will be better then today otherwise losing so life has to improve become better and better and I have to ask myself how am improving myself? Am I making myself better?",
      "and we have to gain every day inshallah until we meet our lord another question that comes you know after we finish our fasting as i said to you also may allah accept after you finish your prayer you say the qabbala may allahu accept your prayer somebody go to hajj you say may allas maqbuleen insha'Allah so he says be among those who are accepted",
      "are accepted, how do we know that it is accepted or not accepted? How do I find out that my fast is accepted? It is something pleasing to Allah SWT. It is a very important concern and there is a way of knowing it although ultimately we know it in the day of judgment inshallah when we are before Allah SWt but there is",
      "The reward of a good deed is the good deed after it. So goodness brings goodness. Goodness breeds goodness. If somebody has done good deeds and it is accepted, the reward will come that you'll be doing some more good deeds.",
      "اور اچھا کرنے کے لئے مجھے دیتا ہے۔ یہ معنی ہے کہ اللہ سبحانہ وتعالیٰ نے اس کی قبول کیا اور توفق کو دیا گیا ہے۔ توفیق ایک خوبصورت بات ہے۔ توفیق یعنی اس کا آسان ہوتا ہے ، آپ کو کام کرنا چاہتا رہا ہے اور آپ سے اکثر امداد دے جائے گا۔ اللہ نے آپ کو اکبر ہوگا اور آپ کو ان کے لیے اکمروں پر آپ کو وہ اکملہ دے گیا۔ لہذا اس اکمبلہ اللہ تعالی",
      "جزا السیع الحسن الحسنت بعدها اور اس طرح بہترین اچھے عقبات ملیں ایک اچھی عقوبہ اگر یہ نہیں تغریب ہوتا ہے تو یہ دوسرا اچڑی سوائے گیا ہے اس لئے رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے کہا کہ ادبع سیعت الحسنا تمہوں کا اچکی عقاب ہوئی اگلی اچہی عصم کی آپ سے ہوا ہے",
      "ہمارے اچھا عمل کو انشاء اللہ کے لئے محسوس کرتی ہے اور ہمیں صرف طرح پڑھنے کی ضرورت سے سب سے بھیگانے والا ہے",
      "السلام علیہ وسلم سیدنا محمد وعلی آلہ وآصحابه الكرام",
      "kekurangan kesatuan, kekurangannya harmoni dan perlindungan kepada orang lain. Ini yang penting. Kita harus memfasihkan di setiap forum, tempat, pusat, dimana-mana sahaja, bahawa para Muslim harus bersama. اعتسّموا بحبل الله جميعا ولا تفرقوا Hold fast to the rope of Allah and be not divided. May Allah bring that unity and harmony among people.",
      "That is that suffering. I mean, this terrible thing that's happening in front... In the 21st century genocide human beings are starving to death and killed and tagged tons of bombs falling on their heads. The whole cities are destroyed. The area is destroyed. All this destruction is happening. And there are so many Muslim countries around not moving",
      "moving, not doing anything. People are of course crying, weeping, praying but the rulers they're not moving, they aren't doing anything if they could not do military action at least they could do diplomatic action break the relations, break the trade all many other things many options were there they could have done why what is happening",
      "کیا ہوتی ہے جو کچھ برائے ہو گئی ہے یہ کچھی ہے آپ کو اس کے ساتھ فکر کرنا چاہتا ہے کیا ہوگیا اور کیسے اپنی حالت کو تحفظ کریں کہ یہ مقابلہ کیا ہے کہ اللہ نے انفسوں سے ایک نوع میں دوسری طرح پہنچایا ہے۔ یہ دوسرا طرف سے تعلق ہے ، ایک طرف ہے کہ سبحانہ وتعالیٰ نہیں تغیرت کرتا وہ ایک خوبصورت صحبت نہیں تعلقت کرتے ہیں اگر لوگ اندازہ",
      "themselves and may become bad people. The good things can become bad, and this will happen. Allah will not change His ni'mah, He'll not take away His ni'Ma from the people unless they change themselves. That's one of the meanings. Another meaning is whatever, good or bad it happens because of your own actions. You have to correct yourself.",
      "We start and then Allah will help you. So may Allah give us the tawfiq and the hidayah.",
      "وطوب علينا إنك أنت التواب الرحيم اللهم إني نسألك إمانا كاملا ويقينا صادقا ولسانا ذاكرا وقلبا خاشعا ورزقه واسعة اللهم إننا نسالك الطوبة قبل الموت والراحة عند الموت فالفوض بالجنة والنجاة من النار وصلى الله تعالى على خير خلقه عباد الله رحمكم الله إن الصلاة تنهى عن الشائع والمنكر ولا ذكر الله أكبر فأقيم الصلا"

      "peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, upon his family and upon his followers. I bear witness that there is no God except Allah and I bear witnesses that Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasalamu alayhi is last and final prophet and messenger. Allah subhanaw taala says in the Quran in the very first ayah surat an-nisa",
      "This ayah, our Prophet used to recite very often in his speeches. And he used to invoke this ayah",
      "this ayah he used to mention this I repeat this ayat when he used invoke human concern compassion kindness among the human beings the is speaks about the nature of",
      "family as well as it speaks about the humanity at large, the relation among all human beings. So it's a very fundamental ayah, very important ayah about Islam, Islam's understanding of society and people. And today there is so much misunderstanding especially",
      "about women and the role of women in Islam. There is so much propaganda against Islam and Muslims, and it has increased. So it is very important for us to understand what are our views, what Islam stands for, and also we have to correct misunderstandings of the people.",
      "on the conceptual level understanding about this whole spectrum of understanding between males and females the ethics what they call it gendered ethics first of all we have to understand that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala created human being as Allah says in the Quran in ninja alone fill up the",
      "representative on this earth and the Khalifa is not only man. Khalifa, is man and woman both because Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala created both of them and Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la mentioned that He made you khalaif and the khalaf the plural of Khalifa",
      "So this is honor. Khalifa is the one who has honor and authority. So authority given by Allah SWT to both males and females. Second thing that you understand, that Allah SWt created Nafsi Wahidah.",
      "Adam and Eve. So, Adam and eve both of them man and woman both of the are coming from the same nafs from the soul from the being and then from adam and eve Allah created many men and women",
      "And actually they are the parents of whole humanity. All human beings, they go back to the same couple Adam and Eve. So whole humanity is united in Adam and eve and adam and eve are united in nafs wahida That means that gender unity would lead to the human unity",
      "And if there is disparity, discrimination between the genders this will also lead to discrimination among human beings. So human beings Allah has given them special... The way Allah created human beings and this is the honor that is given to the human beings, human beings have to understand that honor",
      "honor that Allah has appointed both of them as representative of Allah on this earth and then created everything for the sake of human beings hello color come out of Samaritain or the Jimmy I'm in created for you everything in the heaven and the earth for your sake now",

      "lot of things in common and they have to care for that when islam speaks about hijab when islama speaks about haya when islama speaks about some distance between males and females the purpose is not to discriminate the purpose",

      "Allah has approval that is great. What is one with Allah Akbar? The greatest thing is that Allah will be pleased with them. Allah has approved them. That is the greatest success So Allah SWT mentioned Believing men and believing women they are Awliya",
      "the plural of Wali and this from this comes the word of concept of Vilaya. Vilaya has, of course many meanings it's a very vast comprehensive word but its primary meaning is support. Its primary meaning",
      "believing men and believing women they are supporters of each other. They care for each other, and this is where the society grows. They command what is right, forbid what is wrong, pray, give zakah, and Allah will have mercy on them. So their unity, their working together within",
      "will be enhancing the goodness in the society. And they both have to work on that, and they both had to support. Men have to support the work of women and women have to",
      "and greatness of the society. Allah did not say, the believing men are the guardians of believing women. Allah does not say that. Husband and wife is a different case but men and woman in general",
      "women in general so men are not dominating on women and women are not dominating on men but both of them working for a good cause for the right cause and that cause is these are basic principle they have to work on that",

      "If one group is neglected, put aside and they have no chance to develop. They are no chance study, no chance grow. How are they going to be supporters? How are the going to Oliya? So it is very important that both have to grow and the both have become better and better. That is the whole purpose of Islamic message.",
      "It's a very important ayah that emphasizes that. And then you have in Surat Al-Ahzab, Allah SWT has mentioned qualities of the believers.",
      "Muslim men and women, believing men and woman, obedient man and woman truthful men and",
      "the men and women who fast, the men & women who guard their chastity, and the men&women who remember Allah most. Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and great reward. So 10 qualities are mentioned here. And these qualities are the qualities of believers.",

      "you watch your but your action is the quality to enhance by doing more and You continuously do that Second important thing is that Allah SWT mentioned both These qualities are men quality as well as women quality. It's not only men But men and men both And again, Allah SWt has mentioned is plural did not say al-muslim al muslimeh",
      "Al-mu'minah wal mu'mina, al muslimeena wal muslimaat, al mu'mineena wal mu minat. They are being together as a community of believers men and women Believers and believing men and woman pious man and woman humble men and fasted men and so this is men and Women And they are there in the society working together",
      "in that level so in this sense for the for the from the iman further for the righteousness for the goodness they both should be supporting each other and they much cooperating with each other. And the more they do that, the more there will be uniform balance in development",
      "gender ethics and this can be taken directly from that on the basis of these principles that are given in the I have sort of to Toba and we know not about them only about on the bases of desire that you have a surah al-azhar now you develop a whole program of the development of the society but one should keep",
      "that objective must remain. So the rules are not just for the sake of rule, but the rules have for maqasid, for objectives. And these ayat that I mentioned from Surah At-Tawbah and Surah Al-Ahzab, these are the ayat which give us the maqsad, the objective. If this maqsa is not fulfilled, if there is no growth, if it's no education, there is development,",
      "all the other things become useless, have no meaning. This is how society should be. So what we people should do in any society, in Islamic society, any Muslim country that is we have to develop individuals and groups on that level. Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala has mentioned that al-muslimin amal muslimat not just individuals but groups, community. I would love that",
      "would develop that and if that is the development then that will lead to success for the Azim success here in this life and sexes in the hereafter so we have to develop a balanced program where not just individual rules are emphasized but rather collectivities emphasize",
      "That all the people are in supporting each other in what is right and forbidding What is wrong, and this does work up for both for men and women Men will command. What is right? Women will come on. What it's like It is not only that men will come and men and woman will come one woman we can both come on each other They can tell each other. What you write and what is wrong they can speak of an Express",
      "whether they express in writing, in emails, in chats or whatever but they have to do that in the right way and if they do that right way inshallah society will grow and become development. May we pray to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala give us this understanding and bring a society that is the society of goodness for all and become an example for the world.",

      "In zakat you spend your money for a good cause, for helping the poor and needy as well as for other good causes. And in hajj you spend money when you go to haj. So it is kind of zakat. Of course you don't use zakat money for haj but you use other money. But it is charity also. It is an act of charity.",
      "we control ourselves, we don't eat and drink. But at the same time, we also avoid all the sinful things. And Hajj is the same way. So that's why people say that Hajj includes all the pillars of Islam. So Hajj unique and it has great impact. Let's look at some of the points about Hajj",
      "the acts of worship in islam they are spiritual physical and some of them are financial also so we dedicate our spirit our body and our resources in thankfulness and submission to our lord",
      "So in Salat and Siyam, prayer and fasting, these are beside the spirituality you have physical activity. Salat requires physical action your body is involved there but at the same time and also in fasting. Zakat is financial",
      "give it to the poor and the needy hajj is both physical and financial hajji's obligatory only one or only on those who can afford it because haj is not on every person those who",
      "is obligatory on those who can do it and it is once in life people can do more heights but one time one time high is obligated upon those who are financially capable and also physically able uh if people perform other they will become duffel how many of you are going first time for hajj oh masha allah",
      "most of you are going first time but how many have you performed umrah so you have been there they had that experience alhamdulillah men like sabbat those who are going for slime this is the call hajjatul umra this is your omr's life i mean like you more chances as well but this is",
      "So it is once in life, which is required and others become the nafl haj. It is as you can see here spiritual physical and financial all the three are combined here. Hajj is a sacred act and all ibadahs are sacred",
      "When you stand in Salat, it is a sacred act. When you fast, it's a sacred Act. When we give Zakat, it has a sacred acts. That means it is something that is commanded by Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la and its purpose is to please Allah. But acts are at certain time and a certain place. For example, Salat",
      "Salat, sacred acts, sacred times. Five times we have sacred times, these are the times of salat but you can do it anytime anyplace. You can join at Ardhu Masjidah as the whole earth is made for me as masjid so you can perform salat in your home and your masjids in your office any place you happen to be at the time of salats perform the salat",
      "So it is a sacred act, sacred time but at any place. Fasting is sacred act and at sacred times especially Ramadan fasting on other days also Monday or Thursday people fast or 13th 14th 15th of the month people fast",
      "also but those are nafal fasts. But the fourth fast is in the time of Ramadan and Ramadan becomes a very significant month for that. So it's a sacred act at sacred time. Zakat, sacred act, at any time. Whenever you do zakaat, you give the zakaah. Some people give during Ramadan but it doesn't have to be in Ramadan. But whenever your financial heir comes,",
      "zakat here comes you pay the zakat for that but hajj is unique haj is sacred act sacred time and sacred place and you don't find that in any other ibadah except in haj so it is done this ritual that you perform sacred acts",
      "days, pointed days in the month of Dhul-Hajjah. And of course you go to the place which is Haram, which is sacred area, sacred place, sacred time and sacred acts. This is the beauty of Hajj. The rituals that we have in Islam,",
      "The rituals have objectives. They are not just acts for the sake of acts, but there is a maqsad behind it. So everything that you will be doing in hajj is called manasik and manasic. The Prophet ﷺ said خضو عني مناسككم Take from me your manasics how to perform haj. So they're manasiks. There are certain rules",
      "that you have to follow. Do this and don't do that. But all of these are, have maqsad, objective. And certain benefits that you need to learn from that. So it is important to pay attention to what is fardh, what is sunnah, what",
      "And if you don't do them, then there is no hajj. Some of them are wajib. That means if you miss, you can do sacrifice. Some compensation for that. Some have sunnah and some are nafl. Up to you, do or not do. It's important to know these rules. You also need to know what is halal and haram. What is permissible and what is not permissible?",
      "permissible. And also what is correct and what is wrong way of doing it. Sahih and Fasid. So you have to learn how to do the right things, and if you make mistake, how to make it up. What kind of compensation has to be done? What kind or Fidiya or Kaffarah has to been for that? So these are called Manasik. And this Manasic inshaAllah we will be talking about that.",
      "But then there are maqasid. Maqasids are the objectives of the Hajj. Why these things are done? So, the purpose of Hajj is to show our gratitude to Allah. Allah has given you good health and Allah has",
      "millions of people they cannot perform Hajj, they don't have that those resources and some of them have resources but they are not healthy enough so be thankful to Allah for that. Be thankful to allah that he has given you enough and also made you capable. So Allah made you that and also to develop yourself individually and collectively that is every person who performs Hajj has",
      "to make sure that performing in the right way, connection with Allah. And the whole group perform a hajj. It brings a change. It bring transformation. And that's why Rasulullah says, whosoever performs haj and does not do bad deeds, does not use bad words comes back",
      "the day when his mother gave him birth. Pure and clean. So hajj has that benefit, and that is the maqsad of hajjs, to purify, to clean the people. And if the manasik are done in the right way, and with the purpose objective in mind, then hajjis will be accepted inshallah by Allah SWT.",
      "shirk bi-iwādatirabbihi ahadah. The Qur'an says that those who want to be accepted by Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la, they should do the righteous deeds, correct deeds and do not make any shirk. So عَمَل should be صالح and خالص صالِح means correct, the way that Prophet ﷺ has given us. And also it has to be done with the sincerity of the heart, with the devotion.",
      "And then it requires that the niya must be there, the niyya must sincere. For everything you have to have niyaya and also tawbah and istighfar. Tawbah is repentance, istighfaar is asking Allah's forgiveness",
      "Iman and ihtisab. Rasulullah ﷺ said that do things with iman and ihtisaab. With iman, with the faith in Allah ﷻ and then also remembering that you are going to give the account to Allah for that. So if everything done in the right order, in the",
      "Pay attention to the maqsad as well. Why you are doing it? Why you're there? And whatever you're performing, what am I going to achieve from that? Of course, the basic thing is may Allah accept me. May Allah be pleased with me. My Allah forgive me. Cleanse my sins and wrongdoings. So that's how important it is to pay attention to maqsal. Another thing that is very interesting to learn about hajj",
      "learn about Hajj is, Hajj vertical and horizontal. Vertical is a connection to upward towards Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala and horizontal is on the ground level so we are doing both when you go to Hajj we do both it connects us with Allah it connects",
      "from Adama Ibrahim all the way to the Prophet and also Ismail and Prophet Muhammad so it connects us to that history sacred history, good history blessed history but is also horizontal that it is an experience of the Ummah millions of people go there to perform Hajj and they come from all over",
      "from all over. So this is a kind of see, you can see the Ummah there. So it's an Ummatic experience. So we see Muslims of different races, colors, languages and cultures. There is no other place where you can't see Muslims have such a variety as you can",
      "in such a big scale as you see at high time. We see Muslims of different socio-economic levels, some of them are very rich and some of the are just taken afforded to come to Hajj. And also we see Muslims on various educational and cultural level, highly educated people, sophisticated people but some of",
      "are represented there. And Muslims have different political views, so don't get involved into that but some of them one has one opinion and another opinion, some of the Democrats, some Republicans, some monarchs, they love their king and some of us do not, they're rebellious. So I hope they will not do any rebellion here, just do everything peacefully. But people have different views yes you can see that",
      "and you can see the variety i mean every salat i remember when i go to hajj after this salaam assalamu alaikum where are you from brother where are",
      "any place, Europe, America, all of this. A variety of people. Some of them know English, know Arabic or Urdu so you can talk to them and some of them no. Assalamu alaikum. Waalaikumsalam. Alhamdulillah. That's what we communicate. Assalmu alaika wa a'laikum. Where are you from? China. No English. No Arabic.",
      "no Arabic but it's brothers brotherhood yes so that these are the expressions you can see that you can do the same thing with sisters or brother and also you can different religious levels some of them are very observant they pray",
      "They are not that much used to their religion. But hopefully, Hajj may change them. Some people they change, they repent and they become better people from Hajj. So you can see that spiritual level and commitment to Islam. There are different levels. So expect that! Not because the people have come for Hajj everybody is now Mashallah very religious. No, they're supposed to become religious but there are different",
      "levels. So what are the lessons? Perform the Hajj with devotion. You first of all, you persons, you seek your own, my own Hajj. How am I doing for my Hajj? Am I getting there, the thing that i should get from Hajj or not? Forget about what other people are doing but I mean you're happy to see the people. You stand up someplace and see people who are in the Tawaf",
      "the whole area is like ocean of people i said alhamdulillah happy with that but it's still every person has to his own connection with allah subhanahu wa ta'ala take advantage of that time that you have it's not too much nowadays people are only go for a few days week or two weeks something",
      "and pay attention that what you're supposed to do as a great opportunity to get an opportunity Alhamdulillah many people can do that Hajj but now it's becoming difficult so people financially is also becoming quite expensive and then of course the Ummah has grown they have two billion one billion Muslims there's a large number of Muslims",
      "and if they all come it's not easy even 0.1 percent cannot make it so um and then also how to learn how to be good to each other differences colors all these things how you can do that because quran says that very important point emphasized",
      "Allah specifically mentioned that. Men and women, all of them are there so don't do anything shameful, anything forbidden. Don't commit any sin and don't fight. Don' t argue too much with each other. People have different places okay they're coming together",
      "is the bad words who suit with the bad deeds and jidal is fight especially love each other cooperate with each other",
      "So these are the lessons that we have to learn. That's why we come. Allah says in the Quran, so that you witness the benefits. Inshallah with this few words to remind you about the objective of this unique experience. It's a very different kind of experience than any other ibadah. So that is, that's why hajj is so significant and so important.",
      "Then after that, we'll go to the rules of life. To the monastic. What are the rituals? Any questions related to this or should we go to inshallah to the other part? Somebody has any question? Okay.",
      "So, obligation of Hajj. Allah says in Surah Al-Amran that is the first house that was established on this earth was is the House of Kaaba which is in",
      "blessed place a place of guidance for the world and then Allah's prophet said in hadith",
      "and then he asked again the problem was silent as they ask again third time so perhaps i said i told you whatever if you keep on asking that what will mean and then Allah will make it obligatory upon you every year it will be very difficult for you so just follow that don't be like the people of other communities who kept on asking their prophet various things and then life become difficult for them because the more questions they asked the more difficult it became because the time after shriya",
      "of Tashreeh. So it is one time in life, it is the five Arqans of Islam, it was made obligatory in the sixth year of Hijrah when the Prophet came from Mecca to Medina and in the 6th year of hijra Hajj was made an obligation for every person who can afford it to do that once in life but it should be done as soon as possible",
      "possible. Once you have enough money to make Hajj, you should not delay it. Some jurists say that it should be performed immediately. Others say do it as soon as possible. So still, it is very important not to delay it Conditions of the obligation? A person has to be Muslim adult. It is not obligatory for children",
      "but if people want to take their children they can take them and those who are not uh not reached today the adulthood inshallah the reward will be for the parent and when they grow up then they have to make their own height so if children go they should and they can they can perform tawaf and sai and everything we can do that they can put around",
      "if they are old enough, they can put on ihram. And all of these things that parents will do them inshaAllah they will receive the reward for that but these children when they grow up and they have money and they're in good health they have to perform their own haidah Sanity those people who are have mental problem of course not obligatory on them Capability",
      "physical and financial. And then safety of the way. Just a few years ago, because of COVID-19, people did not do that. Alhamdulillah it is over. If there's other things, war is going on or some other problem at that time, safety is very important in Islam. So if it is safety, then you can do that otherwise",
      "Otherwise, you do when you become safe. For women they have to have a mahram with them. Mahram is husband son father brother I mean those people who one is not supposed to marry because it's haraam to marry so if those men decide man beside the husband if there's any of those then one can go",
      "go. And according to some, if there is a group of women then they can do it all. They can perform because it's for their own safety and security. It is important that they should have that during iddah whether it is the Iddah of divorce or the Iddaah death of the husband widow during her iddah she cannot make Hajj and she should not travel at that time so",
      "So these are conditions for the Hajj. Blessings, we already mentioned that. If a Hajj is done in the right way there is no other reward for it except Jannah and a person becomes pure and clean just like the day mother gave birth. So getting ready make Tawbah, Astaghfar",
      "seek forgiveness and also pay all your debts that you are due immediately if the long-term debt then of course but try to become up-to-date so your mortgage any other loan that you have taken on your car or your business or anything come up to dates it's not that you delaying that and yes you pay your loans",
      "then select the right agency uh you are taking an emergency and through the agent we are going to perform height now see that they're doing that it used to be only by the agencies will use the form that now the government itself has taken it and then of course passport and visa passport to give to leave the country and visa to enter the country so you have that",
      "travel preparation travel lightly don't take too much baggage it becomes very difficult to travel from place to place and all these things so you don't need too many clothes you don' t need anything you can buy there or if you take it take slight thing of course take the necessary medication and do not take too cash with you nowadays people use cards you can use the card",
      "and then also they have money exchange places banks and all of these things are now available so there is no need to carry much cash with you learning the rules of umrah and hajj and then when you arrive most probably you will be arriving in jeddah some people arrive in medina so whatever port you'll arrive",
      "there is delay because especially when you come closer to the time of hygiene it's very crowded so sometimes it takes long time the process to go through that. It has become a little better now I remember sometime people used to spend six hours, eight hours, 12 hours at the airport but now it's not that long",
      "then if the things go smooth, you will feel very happy. If you are expecting three hours and it is done in one hour, oh, mashaAllah. Everything's done by one hour. So that's why mentally we prepare for that. And then there are... One important rule is the rule of Miqat. So Miqa'at, the plural is Mawaqit.",
      "Miqat is of time and place. The time is that Hajj can only be performed in the month of Hajj. Al-Hajju Ashurum Ma'lumaat Allah says in the Quran, Hajj has designated months so at that time but also a special time. 9th of Dhul Hajja is the main day of Haj",
      "hajj if you miss that and before then and after that so these are the for hajji and then maqeet are also of place that is when you come towards makkah from where you must have ihram",
      "designated. So Rasulullah meant six, five places in the Arabian Peninsula around Mecca. So anybody coming from there and then he put the names because normally the roads were coming from that direction. So now the roads have changed but general direction will remain",
      "remain the same thing. So you have this kind of pentagon that is the five points. So any line that goes through these two points and you cross that, whether you go by land or you go via air, you should be in Ihram. Those who come from Medina, the place for them is Zul Hulaifa.",
      "So that is, they call it today Abiyar Ali. The people of Medina are either there or a little before that put on Ihram but don't cross that area. Those who come from Syria, Juhfa. Juhfah is closer to the Red Sea and it is",
      "And it is known as closer to Rabiq. Modern city is Rabi' and then Zaat-e Irk for the people who come from, from the north eastern side Iraq side for them is that Irk",
      "of Najd in Arabia. And then Yalamlam, which is not too far from Mecca, is the direction of Yemen. So those who come from Yemen... So these are the area that was designated by the Prophet as hudud al-haram, as hudood for Miqad, the limits of Miqads.",
      "and anybody coming from that direction or crossing the boundaries of that then they should be in ihram so if you are going from here and you go to jadda so when you come to jada you will be crossing the line and so according to most of the scholars you should not enter jeddah without ihram",
      "If you are going for Umrah or Hajj, if you want to visit your friend, your relatives in Jeddah and spend few days there and you said I'm going to make the intention of Umrah Or Hajj after that. Then you can go in your regular clothes. You don't have to put on Ihram. But then when you want one to make Umrah, or Haj, then you put on ihram from their home",
      "home and then you can go but anyone coming from outside so actually they are there layers of sacredness first of all is Kaaba itself is the most sacred place on this earth then you have the Masjid al-Haram, the blessed masjid",
      "city of Mecca then you have the lines of Miqat, Hudud al-Haram and then you had the world after that. And there are names for each area so Afaq is the area outside the whole world is called Afa'q",
      "boundaries of haram, where it is written there on the road. This area is forbidden for non-Muslims. Only Muslims can go from there. So those are the areas. No, I'm sorry, before that. Before that is the miqat, from where you put on your ihram and then you come to hudud haram and if Allah gives you a chance to go inside the Kaaba, you can go to Kaaba.",
      "You can see that five ways you can enter there. Sacredness to sacredness to secretness. The most blessed, most blessed. So this is what is important to know. And one should not cross the miqat without ihram. If someone does that and your intention is to go hajj and umrah then you have to make sacrifice for that.",
      "If you go to Medina, go to Jeddah and then you go",
      "the place of the people of medina won't we be flying over that big hot area whether you fly or not but your intention is not to go to mecca even if you fly over but your",
      "So that's the name that they use. Or Dhul-Hulaifa. Okay? This is a very important point to remember when you are putting your ihram, do that. And here you can see that in Arabian Peninsula this is the places. Jaffa, I'm sorry.",
      "They are not all exactly the same distance. For example, Medina to Mecca is the longest distance but then 204 kilometers and 95 kilometer or something like that. So Ihram, general body cleaning.",
      "means that you should before that prepare yourself to be very clean. So from home, you can prepare that remove the unwanted hair and take a good shower. And for men, you should have your garment of ihram I'll just come to that. For men they have to prepare that they need garment once you are ready",
      "men are supposed to take off all their clothes and then put one two sheets, one for the lower part of the body another upper body. No underwear no undershirt no socks nothing it's only two bits the basic coffin so that is what men do",
      "same clothes that they have but this should be simple uh simple gloves they can have long shirt whatever the way they do that but they should be properly covered and then after that once you put on that so you wash yourself and in washing you can use of course because you're not in around you could use soap shampoo cream perfume on the body",
      "on the body you can do that but once you are in ihram you cannot use perfume once you're in hieron the soap shampoo will not be used unless it is something that has no perfume no i mean no does",
      "So leftover sand is okay before you put on that?",
      "and women you have got proper covering for your body for that. And now the two raka'a, these are sunnah for ihram it's not required even if you don't pray three rakahs still your ihram is okay but you have to make an intention men and women both we have to",
      "have to make intention. So it's after putting ihram, right? For men yes when they put on the garment of ihram they do that and then make niyah because before that you should not put perfume on the garments of ihrams only on the body you can do that before but after ihram you did not buy no body perfume",
      "perfume no clothes for film so two regards before and to the gods after um because it says tutor cuts yeah before you make the intention i mean your garment is there but intention of him and this is mustahab and then you do sylvia we come to that point but let me show you the most of you who mashallah have been to umrah",
      "So these are... So you have this. This is for the lower part of the body because it's moving on the electronic that you have and there are two ways of doing it one is that you bring both corners together",
      "and then you roll it thread and put a belt you can put the same belt that you use for your trousers you can use that belt enticed and then after that rolled it for you and it's very safe secure another one that many of you may not be familiar with that those people who are from",
      "and then you just but unless you are very confident don't do that",
      "but this is another way and then if you don't have bed you can do that if you have bad or cover one you can use common so it's permissible to do that so to have the tone run out there so that's one way which should be above the belly yeah and this is the second one that we will be putting on on on the upper part of the body",
      "of the body and it is when you are we'll talk about that when you come to tawa then you will be doing this way. That means you have right shoulder there nothing covering on it, and this one you can take and move away. This will be when you're making the tawa and not all the time only for tawa so we'll",
      "but for men don't cover your head what's wrong on your hand leave the head first",
      "and only for the first city shot first three times you go around and then you cover it",
      "now sir you mentioned belt is there a restriction for what kind of like non-stitched belt or the belts when you're putting on your ground is there any restrictions on that yeah you can use anybody that you do that it's more small kind of things are okay or you can have",
      "you can put your passport and put a little money or any other books if you want to have it for the water",
      "you know which which kind of around do you use yeah that one is good because it absorbs the sweat and also",
      "it's not very light so it is good otherwise anything and there is no specific color normally we will have it white around but it could be of any other color yeah permissible now we come to talbia talbiya is saying",
      "saying that i'm here i'm ready and you say the bake so you are saying that I'm here, I'm Here. That's very double the big because the singular is the bug but you are seeing the bike and the baker and twice you're answering that",
      "So people should memorize talbiyah. لَبَّيْكُ اللَّهُمَّ لَبيِّكُ لَوْلَهُ مِنْ أَشْرِيقٍ إِنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنَّعْمَةَ لَكَ وِالْمُلْكَ لَّا شَرِیکًا لَکَ So you're saying, لَ بَيْتُ اللهم لَأْبَيِّك I'm here, I'm Here والله I am here and there is no shariq There is no partner for You You are alone the Lord and God",
      "And again, in alhamdul ni'mat alaik. The praise and the favors all belong to you. It is you should be praised. Ultimate praise is yours. And the favors are yours. You belong to me. The whole thing belongs to you.\" You are the Lord of the worlds. There is no one beside you. So this is the song of Ihaaji",
      "song of the haji this is the slogan of the hiji this is a message and the mission of the hadji that's what we are saying there and this is our life should be that way to recognize that they know god except allah but before you say talbiyya uh you make a decision i mean if you make decisions from your home what are you going to do what kind of hajj you are going to perform so there are three types of haij one is hajja and umrah together",
      "and umrah together. And the second thing is, umrah, then you take off your ihram, put on regular clothes, and when the time of hajj comes, then put ihram for haj. So you have gap, tamatto, it's a gap. You have a time that is not in ihram.",
      "after that you are off around and you are in the regular clothes whatever time you spend in mecca you spend there and then when the time of haj come they put on a hiram again but that time we will put down around from not from mihat from mecca because you're in meccan so you put on your home from mexico",
      "is tamatto. Tamatto, not tomato. And then the fourth and third one is ifrad. Ifrad is you are only making hajj, you're not doing umrah. You've been there performing umrah many times and you don't want to perform umrah now so you can make ifrad or people of Makkah those who live here in Makkah they do",
      "Mecca they do ifrah because they're living there so these are the three so you at a time of ihram when you put on your ihram you say labbayka umratan ma hajja if you're doing quran and you say I'm here ya Allah for umra and Hajj",
      "If you want to do first Umrah and then Hajj, then you say Like for Umrah or making it a motto for Hajj. Or you can say",
      "I'm only making Hajj. So these are Labbayka Umratan or Hajjan? If you're making tomato, you can simply say Labbaykan Umraten",
      "time of Hajj comes and you put the Ihram for Hajj, you can say Labbayka Hajja. So that makes it easy. Labbaykan Umratan or Labbaykha Hajjan. Or if you are doing both. So Quran, remember that Quran is that you put on Ihram and then you go and perform the Umrah. After",
      "that is the side, don't shave. Don't trim your hair. You keep on your ihram and you remain in this state of ihram. All the things that are forbidden in ihram are forbidden on you until you make hajj. You finish your haj. Okay? So that's called kiran. Tamatto, you go and perform umrah and then you're off ihram",
      "off and you are like living like a regular person and then after that when the time of hajj comes to put on hajji so if you go from medina to mecca one day",
      "on the dates that you arrive yeah if you have time you can do it one day more days yes brother",
      "separate and then basically we go take their three days yeah it's easy for you it's easier but you can go and make the valve",
      "just went in december so anyone who was going for a home run they will allow that down",
      "If you are in ihram, remember there are certain things that are forbidden for you. Ihram is that you're coming into a consecrated situation. Hurma or haram. Certain things are forbidden. Of course committing sins anytime is wrong but especially in the state of ihram",
      "getting into fights with others for men only wearing anything tailored to fit the body i mean person should not wear any clothes that are tailored for that purpose and that way you have the neck and the hand and all those things sleeves and all of them that's nothing if",
      "If you have a towel ihram, that's fine. If you don't have a cloth ihram then anything else that you can cover yourself. A lower part of the body or an upper part of your body. During ihram getting married or performing a marriage is forbidden. Using perfume on the body and clothes during ihram. Before ihram we mentioned that you put some perfume on",
      "perfume on the body or cream if you need that, you can put that cream on the bodies but not during a Ram. And clothes don't put any perfume neither before nor after. Hunting, hunting people used to do that not only for pleasure but for food they didn't do that so it is whatever.",
      "And you can resume sharing. Okay, and it's possible intimacy. So these are things that are forbidden",
      "things that are forbidden during Ihram. Things permissible during Ihrama, sometimes some people think so many other things are forbidden, so that's why I mention the things that",
      "The garment of Ihram, the sheets that we have if they are soiled and get dirty you can change them. Changing your garment of ihram is permissible. Taking a shower is permissable but just avoid soap and shampoo. And then after combing the hair, use your fingers but do not use the comb.",
      "Wearing a mask, covering the face or nose because of dust temporarily just slowly you can just put something on your nose and you're passing by and see some dust or smoke. And wearing a mask for health reasons is permissible when you are walking around and you want to avoid too many crowded people will get cold",
      "get cold and coughing. So it's a good idea to have a mask. Scratching of the head or body, covering the head forgetfully. Men are not supposed to cover their hair at their head but if something you just put it there on your head forgetful for a short time this is permissible. Looking at oneself in the mirror",
      "the mirror or smelling perfume you're not wearing it but you are passing by and somebody has perfumed or you stop for a short while at a perfume shop so that's okay it's not forbidden wearing a belt watch glasses or rings they are permissible for men they should not wear",
      "should not wear the jewelry but ring that whatever is the silver ring it is allowed for men to wear they can do that using an umbrella or sitting under cover it's permissible according to the jaffari school of shia",
      "they removed the roof so there's not supposed to be the there is no roof closer to their head so but uh there's no one from the sunday school required that killing of poisonous insects must mosquito and fly and flies and bugs all this",
      "For women only, it is permissible to wear socks but not gloves. Women can wear socks or customary jewelry so want to wear necklace if you want to have bracelets rings permissible but not too much jewelry that which you wear normally in your daily basis you can wear that",
      "So for the umbrella, how practical would that actually be during like the waf?",
      "in the courtyard of the harem so they don't need it but going outside of the haram walking and you take an umbrella this is good it's needed especially people are coming from the cold countries where the weather is not that hot they need that because the sun is very hot what about wearing chapels or shoes",
      "while going for Hajj? Are we allowed to wear them? Yeah, if you are in Ihram, you're not supposed to wear shoes. But you can have slippers that do not cover your ankles and the bone of your upper part of your foot. So no socks and no shoes that cover the Hajj. Unless somebody is sick",
      "and they have to wear something yeah most of the people allow that for health reasons not for both men and women i've heard it differently throughout the years so a woman can't wear masks or can without any reason",
      "can a woman wear masks during hajj yes women who can you can wear uh cover their face other time also i mean without if they don't want to wear what mask you can have something else but mask is allowed during hach for women as well yeah in the hum we can do that and some people say that they should not go their face unless they are",
      "unless they are in the close proximity of other people, strangers. They can put something towards their face. So now you're coming to Makkah.",
      "so when you come in the city of mecca coming by bus like car or by train now if you come closer to city of makkah repeat talbiya should be repeated every time one way or another you should do that",
      "city bless me with this acceptance and then you go to your hotel and you put your luggage if you need to take some rest you can take some less refresh yourself with the tea coffee juice whatever or if there's time of meal you can eat and then get ready to go to haram make your wudu",
      "wudu and if you are because of your journey, you need to have take a shower. You can take a show and then you go to Haram as soon as possible and you can enter the Haram from any place from any direction in some old books it is written enter from Babur Rahma but it is not required",
      "you look at Kaaba if you can stop for a moment and make dua this is your haram, this is kaaba bless this place and bless those who visited so make a dua. You can do any language Arabic English",
      "Arabic, English whatever and then the first thing that you do in any other masjid you go first thing you do tahiyyat al-masjid the two rakah of masjids but in Mecca the first is make tawaf if it's a prayer going on then you pray jama'a going on when you join the jama'. But then after that you make tawaaf",
      "and this is your coming there and especially if you are making umrah then it is also the um so make the last of umrah and uh and as we mentioned that this requires",
      "shoulder bring each other from the shoulder and then leave this beard and this is this is in precise and you every tawaf has seven rounds regardless how big is your round if you are doing it from second level or third level it should be very long",
      "If you are on the ground and closer to Kaava, maybe the whole Tawaf is not as long as one round up there. But still you have to do seven rounds regardless of what is the length. And in the first three rounds, you do the Istiwaa. Also if possible make a Rambla",
      "R-A-M-L, raml. And raml is that walking briskly, walking a little faster in the first shreya. So it's taba' and raml these are recommended not obligatory, not wajib but recommended very much to do that in your tawaf. And this is the tawaff of umrah only, not any other tawaph. Regular tawāf you don't need that, only in umrah",
      "only in Umrah. Why? Because Muslims were forbidden to come to Makkah, Quraysh stopped them and then after Hijra several years after that they came so what I wanted to say the non-Muslims they want to say look at this these people left Makkah",
      "and they became weak. Madinah climate is not that good so they came. So Rasulullah show them your shoulders and walk fast, you are strong. So you still have to do that because this becomes Sunnah.",
      "no you don't need that but if it is with your husband then it's okay you can do that or if you feel that in the crowd you might lost so you can",
      "or if you as they say if this is not your mahram it's not somebody and you feel that you can get lost then you can hold some something some some uh a part of the",
      "Now, Umrah has four arkan. Four important things and if you miss any of them then there is no umrah. So they are called Arkan al-Umrah pillars of Umrah. Ihram. Umrah requires ihram. And tawaf is required. And sa'i is required",
      "And then after that, if you want to get out of the ihram, then you do the halk or qasr. Halk means shaving of the head for men and qasir is when men trim their hair from all over and women can only do a little part of it like less than an inch. So these are very important essentials of umrah.",
      "tawaf so you are coming for tawaaf is like salad so you need tahara you need or ghusl is required and i should do the ghusn",
      "minor pollution or major pollution. That's why women during their menses are not allowed to make tawaap. If they arrive in Mecca and you have to make now umrah, but it's a period starts then they had to postpone it until",
      "clean until uh over that period so because tahara is required for that all the other things they can do i mean for hajj or umrah what other thing but the only thing is tawaf is not allowed yeah and make sure that you are covering yourself properly",
      "yourself properly satural aura the proper covering of the body because men are very around and they have to be extra careful with that and then it is seven rounds every round starts from black stone so when you start your tawaf come to haja as well if it is very crowded",
      "is very crowded you don't have to touch it i mean the thing is that you go and kiss the other as well but if you cannot then you touch it if you can not then you point towards it so if it is very crowd you can point towards",
      "on the right side of the Kaaba. That means you go counterclockwise, you start from Hajar Aswad and go all the way until you come to Rukni Yamani this is a corner of the kaabah that is before the Hajar aswan so between the Kaabah",
      "some distance and this distance could be very long if you are far away but that is the area where you make dua otherwise all the other areas whatever do I want to make can do that there is no specific dua sometimes people have small books they can use that but any other dua that you know you memorize you can do this surah of the quran you can recite",
      "you can do that so that is uh you go from all the way to rock niamani and then where you say um you don't have to touch your clear money don't do that just like other people some people do that but it's not required it's",
      "so this is one shot shout is one round but to complete your tawaf you have to have seven so you can count on your fingers there is a small tasbih for tawaaf which has seven beats",
      "in your finger and do that you have done that yeah they are available outside in the shops there's a special test b for top yes brother you're asking something i'm too it's like a two-part question the first one is if we're in a law family want to take like a break or you want to go",
      "then you have to break it. What do you do? You remember where you stopped and then you resume from there. However, if you are for example in the middle of the third round, then you will start from Hadir Aswad but you have done already two so the third one is not complete so you begin with that.",
      "You get that? So Sheikh, what if after the two or three rounds you get tired and want to take a break or you have to go to the loo, to the bathroom. If you are required to go the bathroom, yeah, we're breaking it but you can start from where you stopped. It's like in your Salat. If somebody is praying with Jama'at",
      "and during the salat you need to go to make your wudu so you can break your salat come and then resume your salad where you stop same thing as you do with tawaf yes like that but tawaaf you stopped for several reasons for various reasons",
      "don't wait too long otherwise you have to start all over again okay so when you break your uh for example you already do two and a half so then you break up the same after you have",
      "why better to start from Hajar Aswad but you already did two so the third one is the one that it is not complete okay so when you do the tawaaf, when you start the tawaf come in front of Hajar aswal raise your hands and then point towards the Hajar",
      "and say Allahu Akbar. You can make an intention in your mind, you say I'm making tawaf, Allah accept from me, make it easy for me, and then after that you move. You move towards the right side of the Kaaba to counterclockwise if you do that. And you do this in the first three shauts for the tawaff of Umrah, you walk a little fast if you can",
      "can but the crowd is too much and you cannot do that and you can not do that now uh allahu akbar sometimes people put their hands like that and they kiss their hand you can do that otherwise you can simply say allah if you got closer then of course and touch it and then you get this",
      "seven rounds then you pray two rakah sunnatul tawaab and you can pray better places maqam ibrahim that is behind the maqama any place if there is no room available there you can play any place in the harem you know you can find a place you can create what are those",
      "and as i mentioned that there is no specific dua for tawaf so you can do the only dua that is mentioned in the hadiths",
      "you say it several times so that is the basic rule of tawaaf after finishing your tawa and praying to rakha you can take some rest you can drink zamzam water available many places either from the faucets or",
      "or from the cooling jars that are there, in containers. You can take the water and drink that. And then you go to the place of Sa'i called Masaa, the place upside. First thing is should go to Safa. You might be closer tomorrow but you have to go to safa because you start from Safa Allah says in the Quran",
      "the symbols of allah so go to safa and go a little up it is uh there are no stairs and there's no hill just just go a",
      "Now, also you have to make seven. Seven rounds. But the seven rounds here are not that you come from Safa to Safa. But Safa is one and then Marwa to Safai second. And then Safa Marwa third and then marwata is fourth. So this is how you count. So each one is one round.",
      "one round, not the whole full round. You can walk if you need a wheelchair, you can use a wheelchair. If you need motor there is a motor chair, electric chair and you want to use it, you could use that. And then also stai mustahab",
      "to have buddho but if one breaks buddhu during sai it's okay you can continue your side yes she's asking if you can take breaks and if you do break you can",
      "continue with the last two. Better to continue unless they are really very tired, but otherwise don't make a break. So that is the continuation is important. Unless there's really need for them. You got it? Your answer there? Did I answer you? Yeah.",
      "no i mean people used to 30 40 years ago and from bomb the hijack could see that but now it's not now what do you know in the direction yes so i heard that the bathroom before we go can we say to do with our water bottle like the things over there",
      "unfortunately the way they design the whole building it's not that easy really can you use your own water bottle to do what we are going through the water yeah",
      "some containers like where they put the use glasses all this thing maybe you can do that at the water bottles and the water stations but don't know some people start making yeah but it's not on top of the trash can if you want to do something there some people will start making wudu some people started making wuzhou with the samsung water",
      "yeah i wish they had done some more consideration of that because it becomes very difficult when you are inside the atom to get out all the way and then come back again so do people ever do we put the water bottle over the trash cans or something if some puts if you have some",
      "have some paper there is no kleenex if you have some kleenexes can be done i mean it's very small amount of water you can make you can just one time you don't need three times",
      "This is water for your mouth, for your nose. There are only four parts of the body that must be washed during wudu. Others are if there's no water available which you cannot do then it won't help. For example wincing the mouth putting the water in the nose It is not farth, this sunnah. So one needs your hands face",
      "Your hands, your face all the way to the... We mention in the Quran So your hands, you face up to the elbows, hands and feet.",
      "feet. Nose in Kully is Sunna and this only one time you don't have to do it three times if there is no water available, if the water is very little yeah so rinsing your mouth and nose is sunna, it's not fire. No it's sunna and tayammum is only hands and face and hands okay",
      "So rules of Sai. Now you come to Safa and Marwa, and they said Tahara is recommended that's why women even their vanses can do Sai. So begin with Safa then go towards Marwa and then from Marwa to Safar total seven times walk fast between the two",
      "There's called green sign, Green sign. And now you have the whole area is lighted green. This was the lower part of the valley. When Hajra was walking, running between Safa and Marwa looking for water she keeping her eyes towards her son Ismail",
      "but this was the deeper part of the valley and she could not see so she ran. So, this whole thing is remembering Hajra and alaihissalam and also our son Ismail alaihis salam and this whole episode is a reminder of mother's love for the child and so you walk in that way. If you can do that",
      "can do that fast not running but fast walk if you can do it's good to do that okay they have a question sorry um is there any special dua for tahmul when you are running when you're going between this area",
      "but this is what people say. There are some books available in which they have mentioned that for every shot, every time you go from Safa to Marwa and Marwa to Safa there is a special dua. And these books have those duas. And when you come to the green sign then you say it's also easy for when you are running",
      "you are running say rabbi it rhymes with the with the fast move as well so and women don't have to run although",
      "that women don't have to all right and so make dua during sai you can talk but don't spend the time when you make phone call calls on spending the time on that people start taking pictures and having face time with the family and others i mean this is the time you are in iraq",
      "all these things read quran the surahs something like that so you started safa and when you come to the last one you end up with marwa once you are there at marwah your umrah is over umrah done now if you want to get out of a ram",
      "of Iran, you go outside the barber shops and then you can ask them whether they want to trim your hair or you want to have shaved. You can do that for women. You could do it yourself. You couldn't do it with somebody else. What you want is just a little thing from your from your head at the end of the hair and cut on there, trim something",
      "trim something. So one can do for oneself, husband can do that, other sisters can do it. I shave my hair on a regular basis so if i want to go back to my hotel and do it myself can I do that or do I have to go in the barber shop? You can go. Yeah yeah I remember at one time somebody was saying",
      "they're saying that you cannot do it yourself he said this is a barber's fatwa somebody in favor of barbers",
      "and this is to collect all the your hair something from the end a fingertip now what is that if you are doing tamato maybe it is better that first time when you",
      "first time when you finish your aura you do the kasra to trim the hair this is for men of course and when you do that you do it because if you share first time you will not have much left i mean if somebody does not have hair or somebody has done that still they can do something so how shaving of",
      "shaving of all the hair off the head, not shaving the beard. Shaving the head that is what is required. Hustlers shortening the hair of the head. Women gather most of the hair and then cut from the end about a size of fingertip. Now let's talk about Hajj.",
      "you want to take a little break or do you want",
      "so let's begin inshallah because we don't have much time",
      "quick announcement gentlemen in the back can we get seated please sir just a quick respectful reminder um if everyone can remain quiet while people are asking questions and what they could be",
      "and while they could be answering the questions this class has also been um",
      "come to hajj so the arcana pillars of ihram being in at arafa father and say between safar these are the four things if you miss any of this height is not valid it's very important to pay attention",
      "And these are the wajibat. If you miss any of this, you require sacrifice. Ihram from Makkah for those who are already in Makkah and outsiders from the Miqat. So we'll come to that point on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. You are in Makka",
      "then you put around from your hotel, from your home wherever you are. You don't need to go to Miqat or that. Those who are coming from outside somebody coming from flying in they have to put on Ihram from Miqa'at not from Makkah and be in Arafah until Maghrib On the 8th of the 9th of Dhul Hajj",
      "hajja you have to be in arafa until maghrib time and the night in musdalifah one should spend a night in was delphi except those who are very old or weak or sick they're allowed to live after the middle of the night the rami will talk about ramia at the jamaat",
      "doing the rami and then halqa qasr cutting the hair short or shaving that is also required for getting out of ihram and tawaf al wada'ah the last tawafe farewell so these are the vajib parts okay quick question you in your clothes regular clothes",
      "close so this is a general sketch of the area here you have it's not most recent one this is the haram kaba and when you go to mina you are going towards the south here this is coming to me now",
      "So, Arafah is there at the end. And then from so on the 8th of Hajj you will be coming to Mina and then you go to Arafa and then return to Muzdalifah and then come back to Mecca. How many days? It takes five days. The whole Hajj is five days",
      "Okay, so let's talk about these five days of Hajj. Five days of hajj. Day one. Day One is the eighth of the Hajja which is probably 27 or 26th of June. So you are in Makkah and you put on your Ihram from your hotel",
      "your hotel those who are coming from outside they do it from the place of and those who were coming from our side they should do tawaf inside if somebody is coming for example you come to medina from medina to mecca on the 8th of the hajja then you have to do tawa",
      "and then you go to Mina. If you are doing ifrad, then tawaf and sayyid, both of them, are enough for you. And after that we'll talk about that. Then you go Mina. It's better to go to the Mina before zuhr on 8th of Dhul Hajjah. So you arrive in Mina, go to your tent, and then pray zuhur and asr",
      "and maghrib and isha and then the next day you pray fajr there so get ready for the next",
      "for that, you are there one day before preparation for that. Then the second day, that means the ninth day of Dhul-Hajjah go to Arafa after Fajr prayer. Anytime before Zuhr, you should be there. One can leave even before Fajar but better to leave after Faja and stay at Arafat from Zuhr to Maghrib. So you arrive in Arafah",
      "have if it's lunch time have lunch take some rest and then the peak time comes that is the time when you make your dua after praying your zuhr and asr both so zohar will be two rakahs",
      "And then after that, if you want to take lunch after that or before that anyway. Then take some rest and then get ready with Vekvudhu, ready for Dua. You already prayed at Asana so now you make Dua and this Dua is better to stand up. That's they call it Khayam",
      "so you stand up if you can if you have no if you",
      "can pray in your tent by yourself yeah with your group but then you must never run there i mean and that is so you come after that and then the",
      "or standing up in Arafah and then make dua. And this dua should continue until sunset so make dua for yourself, for your family, for friends, for the ummah all of these except Hajj. So this is the main dua. Then when the sun sets don't pray Maghrib there you are not allowed to pray Maghrib in Aarafah",
      "but rather you leave after maghrib so it makes little preparation a little before maghreb time and then by maghribs after sunset leave so you and then you come from Arafah you come to Muzdalifah",
      "or if walking is difficult of course the people can take a bus or car there are also trains now train will take you from Arafah to Mazdalifah and arrive in Mazdaliffa anytime after sunset during the night most probably before the middle of the night because crowded takes time when you arrive in Arafat",
      "and it's okay to delay the maghrib that much so pray maghreb when isha there maghrip three raka isha two raka and then you spend a night in buddharipa there are no tents just open so you're homeless so you are just in that area put something under on the ground and if you want to take rest sleep you can do that",
      "also collect the pebbles pebbles you will need seven pebbles for the first day after that when you come to mina because you have three days in minam 10 11 and 12. so if first day only was 7 you will go only to one jawra second day 3",
      "Second day three and third day three. So 21, 21 and then seven so to 49. So 49 pebbles if you want to collect, you can collect from there. A small one chickpea size not big ones chickpeas size. And if you understand spend more, you're going to spend the fourth day also.",
      "If you want to spend four days, you can have another 21. So you will have 70 pebbles. Okay? Here you have Mudalifah during the night until Fajr and then you pray Fajar and leave Mudalfa to Mina. You can take train from there. It's just one station from Mudalfah to Mina",
      "So you arrive in Mina and there are several things that you will do now. And this is the day of Eid, 10th of Dhul Hajjah. Everybody is having Eid but Hujjaj is doing something else. Hujjaaj on that day, November 1st first thing they go to Jamrah Aqba In Muzdalifah there are three Jamrahs Jamrah Ula, Jamrah Busta, Jamra Aqbah",
      "The first Jamrah, second Jamrah and third Jamrah. These are the places where Ibrahim passed and shaitan tried to tell him not to sacrifice his son. So there were three places where Shaitan appeared and he threw stones",
      "on him so this is what most people do in the morning after first you came out from the deliver to me and there's no eat prayers nobody no prayer but our judge has no either all right so they also after after throwing the pebbles so you see here",
      "here leave after a first to me now let me add the general aqua the big gemara some people call it big shaitan there's no shade on there so it's seven pebbles and actually this is kind of a tasbih",
      "Now you stop your talbiyah. Now, you don't say labbayk but what do you say? Say Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar la ilaha illa allahu wala hu akbar allahu akbar wa lillahi alhamd. So takbirat is the start of that and then make sacrifice. Uthaya so there was here for Hajj",
      "But this is only for those who do Qiraan or Tamattaw. Those who do Ifraad, only Hajj there's no Qurbani for them. Qurbana is for Qarin and Mutamattaw So for each Hajji there is one Qurbany male or female? Okay And you can go and do the sacrifice yourself but you can make arrangements",
      "so there are organizations this islamic development bank has stations in there in minna or in mecca medina where you can pay the money for sacrifice so they will tell you how much it will cost but probably it used to be like 400 or 500 reals about 125",
      "25 dollars for one sacrifice so you pay the money. You can say I'm doing a quran my sacrifice was quran, my tamatto we do that. So what they do is this organization will make sacrifices on your behalf on the day when it's supposed to be done and they will do it on the 10th or 11th and the meat is preserved prepared clean",
      "and sent to places in Africa, and other places where people are poor. And they need meat, they fly it there. Before they used to make sacrifice, I mean in the time of the Prophet, they used make sacrifices, dry the meat, collect it and take it home and eat for a month or more. And then after that, people become very negligent.",
      "made haj in 1960 60 62 yeah my first house when i did that at that time we used to walk and the people cut the throat of the animal and leave it there so we sometimes walk over the animals and then the bulldozer will come and throw it all as in their ditch sometimes possible somebody will cut a leg somebody will",
      "and they take it to their tent and roast it and eat with uh otherwise so just waste it but now alhamdulillah good arrangement so if better to take it buy this the coupon for sacrifice and do it and then they'll do it on your behalf where are you going to bring the meat and who is going to cook for you in the hotel they won't allow",
      "Now the third thing after that is... I have a question. Some people say you have to do two Qurbani in Pakistan so your family is there. If you want to, you can do it but you don't have to. Just for one. If making Hajj, this one is enough for you. And those who are at home they do it for themselves. There's no need for two Qorbani. It's not separate from my spouse and myself. It still has to be one, right?",
      "If you're making Hajj, then each one has to do that. For Hajj every person who is making Hajg will do the Qurban if you do Tamattu or Quran and so consider the Qur'an as done whether it's done or not done but since you already paid and made arrangements because it is done. So we don't have to do... We have to apply laws, right? But we have to go for Hajj as well even if we've done it",
      "we've done it in Pakistan, say. No no for Qurbani you cannot do in Pakistan. It has to be done there in Mina. So it is done in Mina by buying the coupons so you did first thing is you did the throwing the stones at Jabra and the way of throwing the stone is each person has to do seven if somebody cannot then",
      "not then another person can do and there we have first two for your own behalf and then another personal yeah so i have seven pebbles and don't throw all the seven at once but rather put one 70 cap pebbles in your left hand and they take one and say this is",
      "You go to for Khorwani or you made the arrangement for Khoorvani. Can we buy the coupons beforehand? Yeah, you can buy before. You could buy in Makkah, you could buy it in Medina. Now, Khalkh or Pasar. After that now you have to get out of Aram and out of aram is that you have the hair trimmed",
      "hair trimmed or shaved okay and when this is done you are out of her now you can go and take a shower put on your clothes this is like celebration so you are all around and now if everything is allowed that's what is allowed for the for a common person except husband wife relationship",
      "they cannot do that and after that the one has to go to me to makkah and do tawaf ifada is part of hajj and this the father does not need a haram you do it in your clothes and so you make the off and then you make a side for for tomato or from quran you may say if you have not done before going",
      "going to Mecca, from Mecca to Mina. So you do tawaf and say. If you did it before? You can do it before too. Okay. If he wants, if he want to, he can do before going for Hajj. So, you can do that and once you have done tawaafi further now you are haji. The Hajj is done. The only thing now you have to do is that you have",
      "three days for rami and don't skip that so one has to spend uh even if the evening you go but many people do it on the 10th",
      "father and then come back don't spend the whole night in mecca come back to your tent and the next day next day is 11th of the hajja and this is the fourth day of hajj and this day you have to make rami and now you do rameon all the three go to first one the small one the middle one and",
      "Once you do the Rami on the first one, seven times pebble. After that, you come to a corner and make dua. Second one, come to your corner and do dua. The third one don't stop after that just leave. Come back to your tent. You pray five times a day there. You meet people greet people attend lectures or other programs there",
      "And then the second day, which is the twelfth. The fifth day. The twelfths of Dhul-Hajjah. Do the same thing. You have three places as you go through the pebbles. The best time for throwing the pebble is after Zuhr prayer until Maghrib time. And if you want to leave, you can leave on the 12th and come to Makkah",
      "if you want to stay one more day, you can stay one day. If you stay one other day then you have to do all the three jamarāt and do the pebbles. You mean stay one another day? And after that you leave and come back to Makkah. And when you come back from Makkah, the only thing that you have",
      "you should do it before you leave. Just a few hours before that so that you can catch your bus or your train and then you want to go to Medina, you can go to Madinah or if you have done already, you want",
      "the same points I have here, but let me mention these are the five days of Hajj. Eighth of Dhul-Hajja you are from Makkah to Mina. Ninth from Mina to Arafah. Tenth from Muzdalifah to Mina, so it's from Mina and then from Arafa to Muzdalfah after sunset",
      "and then from Muzdalifah to Mina. And then you go from Mina to Mecca for Tawaf-e Fada, and you do the Sai of Hajj, and come back to Mina So 11th you are in Mina 12th you're in Mina but 12th You can leave from Mina To Mecca so this is the way your itinerary for the days of hajj",
      "extra day that's sixth day let me after zohar and go to makkah but before departure you make the offer everybody do it for hajj is required",
      "people say it's better to do that also but for hajj it is required i have a question uh how far is like minna from makkah for example the days we are in mina for the rami can we go to do rameen in morning and then go to yeah i mean very crowded so better to walk it will take about an hour or an hour",
      "so we can do the last like do to me in the morning and then do it remember it's very crowded because you have to take some time yes anybody else sure you said that there was a good time to do depending where you are in mina is a big place sometime going all the way from your tent to",
      "to the place of rami takes long time and then uh just like a higher question did prophet ibrahim do this for three days as well or what did he do this only for one day all that happened in one day no property because we're following this yeah did he",
      "but this is the sunnah of the process.",
      "before you do the same. You can't do that. Doesn't mean that you do two tawafs, one tawf is enough for both. If for some excuse you want to leave then do that okay anyway the information that I learned from seminars that i heard was that once you complete your tawafe then you start before you start this thing make an intention that also makes them as a father and you can",
      "So let me talk about briefly about sacrifice. It is required for those who perform hajj, tamattu or qiraan not ifrah. Hadi is the sacrificial animal sheep goat cow or camel",
      "one sheep or goat enough for one person seven persons can share in one cow or camel those who cannot afford to make sacrifice fast three days during heights and seven days when you come home",
      "Three days there, you fast and seven days when you come back home. And do the sacrifice or make arrangements with your Hajj group or IDB Islamic Development Bank. They have their booths all over Mecca, Medina and other places so you can do that. Alright? And then visit of Medina.",
      "it is not part of Hajj if somebody does not go to Medina his Hajj is complete so somebody has been to medina many times so this time he does not have time you can perform Hajj and come back but it is a very important part of the journey it is good to go to medinah you are there all the way and then you don't go to the masjid of the prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam",
      "pray for Riyadhul Jannah Turaqah, Tahiyyat al-Masjid",
      "the greetings of the masjid says salam near the grave of the prophet so try to go all the way to the grave and stand which is called muwajah sharifa face to face and you have in the grave",
      "peace be unto you messenger of allah peace be to you the best creation of allahu and then you go stop and he says",
      "and then you take few steps, and you see the grave of Umar. You don't see the graves. It's a hujra around the screen. And inside the screen there are three graves but they're covering also there. So you come and say As-salamu alaykum Ya Umar ibn Al Khattab, Ya Saniya Khalifa Rasulullah or second Khalifa of Rasulallah",
      "then after that move because a lot of people will be behind you so you just move and turns out inside the masjid or outside turn towards qibla and make dua because we are there at the grave not to make dua at the graveyard we are making dua to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala but we're getting salam so say salaam at the",
      "Because the grave of the Prophet, when you face the grave, you are not facing Qibla. You are actually... your back is towards Qibila. So that's how you do that. For women there are special times. Morning time, night time so they can go at that time. If for some reason you are unable to be in the Muwajaha Sharifa where you can be face-to-face",
      "then you can do it from any place in the haram yeah that was my question when we went to umrah in november it was still very crowded and they had special timings for men and women so you have to physically go into the riaz al jannah",
      "between my house and my member from where the professor used to give the khutbah. The space between my houses is a garden from the gardens of paradise so it is highly recommended to pray and at least you have two rakah there but if you cannot do it, you cannot pray. And then if you go to as I said if you are not able to stand in front of the grave",
      "of the grave and then you can do it from outside also especially",
      "you don't have to do anything else just say salaam and leave it with great respect and uh now in medina as long as you are in madina pray for the prayers in the masjid so you get more reward each other prayer in my must is better than one thousand prayers in any other place",
      "better to take advantage of that and also if possible visit other places in medina there are some historic sites for example you can go to uhud the battle of took place you go to masjid quba the first masjids that was going to visit that muster as if you make wudu in medinah go to oba and pray there as if",
      "and masjid al-qibilatayn, Masjid abtu qiblan because people used to pray toward Jerusalem and then they turned towards Mecca so both one at one time they prayed in the beginning towards Masjad al-Aqsa and then the prayer of Masjd al-Kharam and Khandaq area so and then some other places as well so whatever time if you have you can visit you can",
      "or do shopping for kajus for dates and other things gifts for people and then you come back inshallah may allah bring that complete the hajj and ziyarah alhamdulillah"

      "Prophet Muhammad and for righteousness, for goodness. They be role models and this is what they remind the humanity about that. That human beings should be obedient to Allah. They should be the servants of Allah. So to be in the middle, to be the people who are in the balance not go to any extreme,",

Don't be exaggerating in your religion but rather follow the path which is the path of wasatiyya and balanced path. Neither too worldly nor to otherworldly both of them are important is emphasized",
      "It's emphasized. Allah says in the Quran, in Surah Al-A'raf, O children of Adam, take your adornment for every prayer, for every time of prayer, every place of prayer. Come in good dress, proper dress and eat and drink. But do not",
      "waste. Do not do extravagance because Allah does not like extravagant people. Say, who has forbidden the beautiful things of this life?",
      "this life Allah has taught them out for the people for his servant and good food who has forbidden the good food halal food it is for the",
      "خالصة لهم. سيكون بشكل صحيح لهم وخاص لهم في الآخرة. ولكن لديهم تقرير. قال الله هذا هو الطريقة التي نشرها في آياتنا. للأعلى من الناس أن يعرفون ذلك.",
      "Surah Al-Haraf, surah number 7.",
      "think that Allah has not revealed any authority for that and he is say things from your own mind from your thinking whims not from the revelation of Allah SWT, the way Allah SWt has spoken about that so this is what Islam emphasizes that that is that it live a balanced in life if you summarize the basic philosophy",
      "Jism and Roh. Both of them are there. Jism without roh, dead. Go and bury that. So jism has to be there and then you have roh. Roh, jism is from the earth. Allah SWT created human being from dust. So, jisme is from",
      "the earth. The Ruh is from Allah. Ruh means command of my Lord so the Ruh from above, body is beneath from Earth and human beings are a beautiful combination",

      "The food for the body is food and drink. The food of the soul is prayer. The recitation of Quran, the remembrance of Allah SWT doing good things that is the food for soul. And the soul has to be nourished. There are many people who take care of their bodies very well but their souls are starving. Their souls are hungry. Sometimes they even kill the soul.",
      "They act, they walk and move but they are dead. But they're not living like the real living people. The real living are those whose soul is alive and body is strong and good. So that is one aspect of it. That you are body and soul. The second thing Islam says that you are individual. And as individual you have your individuality",
      "But at the same time, you are society. You are community. You were born in a family. No human being is an island. Every human being has connected. Connection to our parents, connection to our family, connection with our neighbors, our neighborhood connected to other neighborhoods, the county, the city, the country, the globe, the world.",

      "to the community. The third thing that Islam says is, that you are here in this world and then there will be death and you will be in the hereafter. So there is dunya and akhira. You're not only here, you're here for a time that Allah has determined for you. So you live here. Do not ignore this life but this life is not",
      "life beyond this life and that is called akhira so dunya and akhara so jism and rooh individual and society and dunia and akhrar the whole teachings of Islam are covered in that so this is the basic philosophy of Islam.

Everybody has a right so it is important to pay attention to that",

Patient means that you are steadfast. You remain firm on your principle. Like at the time of Badr, the Battle of Badra Rasulullah asked the Sahaba Ansar and the Muhajirin",

      "لیکن یہ ایسا چیز ہے جو اس کے ساتھ بھی تعلق کر رہا ہے کہ وہ کیا ہوا ہے پروفیسر صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم سے مسجد الاقصاء میں جروسلم سے دنیا اور کچھ محکمت ہیں۔ یہ نیت میں ہوتا ہے۔ تو یہ عطا تھا جو دے گئی ہے",
      "كان مخطئا من المسجد الحرام إلى المسلح الأقصى",
      "لیکن ہمارے علماء کہتے ہیں کہ وہ اپنی گھر سے مسجد الحرام کے پاس جاتا تھا اور اسرا کی مصطفیٰان میں بھی ہوئی ہے۔ تو یہی وجہ سے قرآن کہتا ہے کہ رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے اس کے گھری میں رکھا ہے، جبریل آیا گیا اسے وقت میں حرام کا سال کر دیا اور بعد اس کے ذوالوں کو بعض تعلقات کے طور پر",
      "اس کا دنیا کھڑا اور آئی تھی ، اللہ سبحانہ وتعالیٰ کے مقابلے کی تصور کرتے تھے۔ ہم اپنے نفس کو صرف وضوح کرنا ہے کہ مسجد پر آئیں گے لہذا اللہ تعالی نے حسین سے بات کیا جب وہ اللہ فرمائے تو انہوں نے ایک خوبصورت شکریہ کیا اور اس کا قسم شق الصدر",
      "براقب ایک خاص تخصیص ہے جو دون البغل اور فوق الحمر کہا تھا۔ براکر ایک مختلف تخ صورت ہے یہ کچھ سوڑے سے مول اور ڈنکی سے بہتر ہے اس لئے پسند ہوتا ہے اور اس نے اس کے لئیے رائد کیا",

      "اور جرسلم کیوں جروسلم کیا ہے؟ لیکن جرسم اسلام میں اچھا موقع تھا۔ آخری طور پر مسلماں کو بہت سارے چیزیں ہوتی ہیں، خاص طور سے وہ جو مسجد الاقصاء کے داخل ہو رہے ہیں۔ ان کے پاس مسجدا الاقثاء ہیں۔ وہ کام کر رہی ہیں۔ مشکلات، مشکالات جو پلسطین اور جروسلم کا لوگوں کے لئے ہے۔ لیکι جروسم اس الاسلام میں بہرحالی موقعت ہے۔",

      "So Rasulullah took him from Masjid Al-Aqsa to Masjido Al-Haram. That means there was a masjid building there, masjids is the place also. I mean that is the places of Masjidi al-Akasa so he was taken to the place of Masjih al- Aksa and Masjide Haram was not as we have it today but Masjde Haram were small place and Kaaba was there that's it",

      "corruption, not something that intoxicates and brings things. So Rasulullah took the cup of water and refused the cup wine. And that is the way of Islam. Islam is a way of fitrah. Islam in a way purity and goodness so that was symbolic thing. And then after that Jibreel presented him the ladder, Nairaj.",
      "جو سمجھتے ہیں اور سمدہ بھی نہیں ہے سمیت اس کی پرگزار میں ہے لہذا وہ نے اسے سمیں سے دیا ہے اور ایک سمین کے مقابلے میں کس طرف کا فرصت ہے کہ اللہ کو یہاں ہوتا ہے تو انہوں نے سب سو سامنا رکھا اور رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے اس کے پاس تک پڑھا گیا اور اللہ تعالیٰ یعنی انبیاء اللہ کے نبیات",

Some people say that he saw Allah, some said no, he did not see Allah but he heard. Allah spoke to him. Noorun, the saying is Noor un inni arah He's Noor, Allah is Noors, Allah was Noor al samawati wal ard. Allah is the Noor and he said inni Arah I saw Him",
      "I saw him. The other way of reading it, Noorun Anna Arah When the Prophet was asked about that he said Noor is a noor how can i see? I mean the noor is you cannot pinpoint that this is the place so noor Allah is noor and then he so what so he had the experience of noor of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and he came very close to allah Qaba qawseyni aw adna",
      "اس کے باقی یا یہاں سے بہت قریب اللہ سبحانہ وتعالی اور پھر اللہ صلوٰی وآلہ وسلم نے اوہا اے لائے عبد ہمارے آنکھوں کو توفیق کریں گے جس کی وہ کہتا ہے ، ان کا ایک خوبصورت محسوس ہے اور آپ اس محصولات کو تطور نہیں دیکھ سکتے ہیں۔ اللہ نے اس کے لئے کچھ چیزوں میں معلومات کیا تھا۔",
      "The Prophet said that these two ayat, if somebody recite them before going to sleep, they will be sufficient for him. But Allah's blessing is way to Jannah",
      "ومن ثم الهدى للجنة لذلك من الجيد أن تقوم بالتوضيح بهم خاصة قبل النوم اضع يديك على الجانب الصفر والساعة وقالوا الله أعد قل عبد البلفلاء قل أبو الأب الناس ثم قل هذه الآيات ثم اسأل الله سبحانه وتعالى",
      "میں نے آپ کے پاس مانگا ، میں نے اپنے روحوں سے بھیجا ، میری جانب کیا ہے ، میں ہماری دل کو آپ کے ساتھ لیا گئی۔ میں نے تمہیں اس کے پر آتا ہے۔ میں آپ کے لئے موجود نہیں ہوں اور کسی کو مجھے حافظ کر سکتا ، مجدد میں مجاد نہیں ہوگا۔ میں ان کے نام میں مانتا ہوں ، میں آپ کا صفحہ مانڈا ہوتا ہوا۔",
      "اس کا ایسا کہتے ہیں کہ یہ بہت مهم ہے کہ کتاب کو دیکھیں اور وہ سوالوں سے نماز کریں",
      "ایک بہترین آیات، مقید اور دعا اللہ تعالیٰ کا حافظ ہے۔ اور اس نے دوسرا عطا کیا ہے صلاة۔ ہمارے سب سے کرنے والے پریشان۔ اللہ سبحانہ وآلہ وسلم نے اس کے لئے کہا ، آپ اور آپ لوگوں کو، آپ کی امت 50 پریشر کسی روز پیدا چکنا چاہئے۔ تو رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلام اللہ کا سورج بہرحال تھا۔ وہ اسے ختم کیا۔",
      "He took it, okay. This is a command I'll do that So when he came to back He passed by Ibrahim did not say anything But then he came You know",
      "They did not have that much but still they could not do. So go and ask that Allah reduce for you. So Rasulullah goes back and forth every time he goes, reduced 10 and finally there were only 5. And Musa A.S. would go and asked him for more reduction. But Rasulallah says, I am shy to go and",
      "اس لئے اللہ تعالیٰ نے کہا کہ میری فرض وہ ہے یہ 50 دعویں ہیں جس کے لئیے اللهم اپنے بات کو سب سے محسوس کرتے ہیں",
      "آپ کو یہاں بہت شکر کریں، لیکن وہ کہتے ہیں کہ آپ کے روحانی ایسی ہے۔ آپ کا روحت 50 دعائیں سے ملتی ہے اور حقیقت میں رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم ہمارے دن 50 دینوں پریشان کیا جاتا ہے۔ نہیں 50 دنیاں لیکر 50 رکعہ میں میں انگیز سالوں میں آپ کچھ نصف سنتیں تھی اور ثبوت 3 وطن اور بعد آپ 8 رکاعہ",
      "اور پھر آپ کو اشراق یا دوہا رکعہ کرتے ہیں۔ اور کچھ اور نوافل کے ساتھ ان میں سے آپ ان کی بھی مجید کریں گے۔ وہ 50 سے زیادہ ہے۔ تو رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم اس کا تابعتہ کیا تھا۔ ہماری رکعة اللہ تعالیٰ کا عطا فرمائی ہے۔ لہذا وہ رکاع ہیں۔ تو الرسول نے اس کا پیدا کیا اور وہ اس کا قبول کیا کہ 17 یا 15 بعد یہ نواپل، وہ اس کے بعد کرنا چاہئے",
      "So that is the greatest gift that was given and Rasulullah used to emphasize that. There is a saying called As-salatu mi'raj al mu'mineen Salat is the mi'raji of the believers Although the hadith is not strong But the meaning is correct Meaning, same as the meaning That is the experience that Rasulallah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam had in Mi'raj A similar experience if you pray",
      "اگر آپ صحیح طریقے میں پڑھتے ہیں، صحيح طرح اور دائمان میں تو آپ کو میراج کے تفاوت کریں گے اللہ سبحانہ وتعالیٰ سے قربانی۔ خاص طور پر جب آپ سجدہ رکھیں گئے تو ، حضرت عزیز نے کہا کہ ایک شخص اللہ تعالی کا کلیس ہے جب وہ یا وہ اس کی سجدا ہے۔",
      "صحابہ رب العالی کے لئے بھی نہیں کہتا ہے جو آپ کو دعوت کی طرف مل سکتے ہیں اسی طرح میں ہمیں ایک حجدہ سے آگے پڑھتا ہوں جس کا اللہ نے ایک شخص کے قریب اپنے نظام کرنا چاہتا",
      "جو آپ کو ایسا کام کرنے کی وجہ سے ہوتا ہے یہ صدقہ ان لوگوں کو بھراتا ہے اس نے سجدہ کے ملکوں سے بھرایا گیا تھانزادوں سے لباس کیا کہ وہ جو اللہ کا سجدا نہیں کرتے ہیں وہ سب کچھ چیزیں پڑھتے رہتے اور اس کے نمازوں میں بھی نہیں مطلب نہیں ہوئے تو یہ آپ کو بھیجائے گا، آپ کو سالوں سے سجدة سے بھیگا",
      "اللہ کے ساتھ ایک صدق نہیں کرتے ہیں۔ آپ خود بخور ہوتے ہیں ، لا شجد ہے ، اللہ سے مختلف ہے۔ تو ہم اللہ سبحانہ وتعالیٰ سے مستعدر نہیں کریں گے۔ لہذا اللہ نے اس کی صدقت دیا اور ان کو اللہ کا قریبی طرف دیئے۔ صدقة کرو اور کل جائیں۔ آپ یہ پڑھتے ہو؟ سورة العلاق کے آخری میں ، صدا کرو و قریض جائے۔ یہ صدی ہے۔",
      "آپ کو پیار کرنے کے لئے ایک مطلب ہے کہ صلاة بہت سمجھا جاتا ہے۔",

      "بہت سے سوالیں مجھے ان کے لئے معاف کردی گا ، اللہ ہمارے پاس اس طرح کی صلاة دے گا جس کا صلاح ہمیں سب کچھ غلطوں سے حفاظت کردیا اور ہم کو اللہ تعالیٰ کے قریب آگائے گی۔ بعد ذات رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم جروسلوم میں آیا تھا اور بعد ذلك وہ مکہ میں پڑھ گیا اور وہ کہتے ہیں کہ یہ چند فور میں ہوا ہے",
      "And the whole thing happened in a very short time. And then after that, he told the people of Mecca that this is what happened. Last night I went to Jerusalem and from there I went back to heaven. So people laughed. What is this? Not believers, not Muslims but other people who were listening they laughed.",
      "show us, I mean tell us what did you see in Jerusalem? And the Prophet ﷺ of course he was in that experience. He did not pay much attention to buildings and all those things so he said that Rasulullah ﷺ said how am I going to describe that? Then Allah ﷻ showed him the whole Jerusalem in front of his eyes and the Prophet said yes, yes this is it",
      "جیروسلمانوں کے مرکز کو اس نے دیکھا اور وہ اسے ذہن سے ذہنا کہہ رہا ہے۔ لہذا آپ نے کہا کہ تصور صحیح ہے کیونکہ مکہ میں لوگ ہمارے ساتھ انہیں اتنا گئے تھے جو یہاں پڑھتے ہیں اور وہ جیراسلم کا معلوم ہوئے ہیں تو وہ بھی خوف کر رہے تھا کہ وہ کبھی نہیں تھا، لیکن کیوں اس نے ذہنت کی طرف کہہ کریا کہ وہ چند مہینے سے مکة سے جیروسلمان سے جائے گی اور آپ نے یہاً کہا جس وقت آپ ایک نام میں آج اور آج آگیا جاؤ گیا تو حضرت اللہ تعالیٰ نے اس سے بتایا",
      "لیکن جو انہوں نے یقین کیا تو وہ یقینا نہیں تھے۔ اب بکر صدیق رضی اللہ عنہ سے یہی یقين نہیں تھا۔ اس کے ساتھ کسی نے کہا کہ آپ کو اپنے صاحب اور دوستان کا مطلب ہے؟ وہ کہتا ہے کہ وہ جلسلم میں گیا تھا اور آگئے پڑھ گیا۔ آپ اسے یقن کرتے ہیں؟ اب بكر صديق راضا ہوسکتا کہتے ہو، اگر وہ اپنا یقنت کہتی ہے",
      "If he says that, I believe that. How come? He tells me every now and then comes to him the message from heaven. And it is much more than a visit. So I believe it. I believe he received the message of heaven. That if he said that he saw this and that... It's possible. It's possib-possible. Possible. If you have strong faith, you recognize that.",
      "اور اس میں بہت ساری رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے کچھ روابط کیا۔ رسواللہ صلاة والسلام نے ہر جگہ اور خدا کو دیکھا اور رسالہ صالح نے لوگوں سے اپنے مذکورات کے لئے کیا تھا جب وہ غم کریں گے، انہوں نے انہیں کیا ہوگیا کہ وہ نہیں عافق کریں اور یہ بھی اپنا حضرت ہے جو اچھا نام کرتا ہے ، یہ پوری قصہ ہے ، بہٹی قسم ہے اور یہ ایک بہہ اهمی طریقہ ہے کہ آپ اس کا فهم کریں۔ تو یہ ایسا عزت ہے جس نے پروفیسر صلوٰآم کے پاس ہوا",
      "One of the greatest miracles of Rasulullah is Quran. But there are many other miracles and among them is Isra'il Mi'raj. May Allah help us to understand his message and the honour of the Prophet.",
      "A human can reach to that level. So this is the honor of the whole humanity. May Allah SWT give us that honor, that we appreciate the blessings of Allah SWt and appreciate this vision of Prophet SAW.",

They walked with the grandfather. And so there was a link, there was bond between the generations. And that multi-generational homes are no more except very few. The second thing was because of the economic pressure",

It's a philosophy that developed which means myself I my own identity",
      "My own identity, my own independence, my only body that is what individualism is all. And of course that made the young people especially feeling I'm individual, I am myself. Another thing is that what is known as too much emphasis on group, groupism,",
      "all these kind of groups, clubs, parties. And this emphasis happened, this created stereotypes. This created ethnocentrism. This create prejudices. So all of these things together they have created the phenomena or what is known as generation gap. Islam wants the generations to work",
      "He does not belong to us who does not respect the elders among us and who does care, has no mercy and kindness towards the younger among us. The young and old both care for each other. Respect means appreciation. Respect mean thank gratitude. Respect",
      "younger people for the older people if you see them you begin with the greetings don't expect that they greet you but you greet them the younger person should greet the older person if you are sitting stand up and give them your seat if they need help provide them to help and many other ways listen",
      "but still you have to respect that is the kind of society that Islam created and Islam wants to have that and we have to remind ourselves and we",
      "Those who came after, that is the younger people. They say our Lord forgive us and forgive our brothers who were before us. Who predecessors. Who were before as our predecessors with Iman and do not have any in our heart any grudge",
      "any grudge, any hate for those who believe our Lord you are the merciful. You are the kind. This is very different from the people of hell. This way of the believers. This was the way of people of Jannah. But Quran mentions the way to the people in Hell. The generation that comes after curses, the regeneration that was before",
      "before so they say all kind of things against the people who were before them and that's not the way of the believers so believer should try to see that how to bridge this generation gap so called great generation gap if that exists in any family is any group that they should try remove that they shall remove that by as much as possible be close",
      "multi-generation families you should have that if it is possible if it's not possible that way and your the grandparents are living close by then visit them more often have more communication with them alhamdulillah most of the families now they have their grandparents are here it's",
      "كانت أبنائك مره وعندما تكون الأمان في المدينة، يجلبون منهم الابناء",
      "will bring a good relation with others so that is on the level of your own elders be good to your own eldest but Islam does not say that only be good for your own elder. Islam says it all the elders, elders of the family even the elders of other people elders in the society Muslims or non-Muslims give respect to their older people",
      "people. The value of Islam is highly emphasized in Islam and that is done through care and kindness if you see somebody is in need go and help that person young or old but especially the older people and also recognize that",
      "age they become slow. Slow in the movement, in the mobility. Slow their communication, throwing their understanding so try to have that patience with them. So listen to them be patient with them help them especially if your parents are in need then you provide for them.",

      "Alhamdulillah. Another thing I would like to emphasize is religion and culture. Religion is, as far as we are concerned, Muslims, religion that is given to us by Allah SWT",
      "by Allah and his prophet Muhammad. Religion does not change. Religion is what it was 1400 years ago, and it did not change because you changed the place. You move from one country to another country, from one area to another area, from time to another time. So time, place, religion's permanent values.",
      "what is essential of the quran and sunnah these are the permanent values but culture is man-made things it is human development and culture is very important and people have different cultures and that culture of different times conference culture of",
      "But take whatever is good, whatever meets the principles of Islam, values of Islam and you can benefit from that. And also not everything that you have from your own culture, your ancestral culture, not everything is good. Not everything is religion. Sometimes people confuse that so it is important to meet our children, our youth with that understanding.",
      "They may have different values which they have acquired from the living in this society. So we have to see what values are good, what values not good? If the values are fine it doesn't make any difference if they're of this area or another area but if they are not good then that's not good. Not accept them even if they come back home. And other thing is that we would like to see our youth progress",
      "to grow following the principle of Islam but at the same time learning, acquiring knowledge taking benefit of that and we want them to be successful as Muslims in their religion, in their faith successful in their families successful in",
      "In their Islamic centers, in the community centers, and the organization. So they can learn how to become leaders of the people, of the community, and leaders here in America. May Allah bless them. May allah bless young and old both and keep us always on the right path. Remember that it is something said about Ali, that he said",

      "الحمد لله الحمداً كثيراً طيباً مغاركاً فيه والصلاة والسلام على سيد الأنام سيدنا ونبينا محمد وعلى آله وأصحابه الكرام بلّغ رسالة وأدى الأمانة ونصح الأمة وكشف الغُمَّ وجاهد في الله حق جهاده",
      "our Creator, the Lord of the worlds and peace and blessings upon all the Prophets of Allah from Adam to Noah, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa. And the last and final Prophet Muhammad. I bear witness that there is no God except Allah. And I bear a witness that Muhammad is his last and",
      "Messenger so nice to see all of you here masha'allah the thriving community may Allah bless you and bless your families and bless All the Muslims protect them keep them on the right path And bless the humanity to the right part millets the humanity live in peace and harmony our religion Islam The religion emphasizes family life very much it",
      "emphasizes family relations and Islam talks about family on three levels there is one is the primary level which is the biological family parents children husband wife close relatives so that is a biological family and it's emphasized very much that you should have good relation with each other the Quran",
      "and those who unite the family keep this bond Allah SWT will bless them so as-salaamun wasalani faqta'u man qata'ani as the Prophet SAW said about that that Allah said about rahm, that those who connect with me I'll connect with them those who break with me, I'll break with them so Allah SWt blesses the people who are good to their family members but family is also",
      "So that's another level of family. The third level of the family is the world family. All human beings have one family because they are all children of Adam and Eve. So we are connected with Adam and to everyone, and that's why Allah emphasizes that",
      "Allah has created one single male and female. So, one pair of male and females Allah created, and through this Allah created all people, and made you nations and tribes so that you may know each other. So all these levels of family that shows the Islam's concern for family, that the biological family, faith family, world family, human family",
      "and be good to your parent. So, parents and children they should have a loving relationship, a respectful relationship. Older people care for the younger people. And the younger respect and honor the elders. This is how the family should be. What they call it today as generation gap that has no place in Islam. It is alien to Islam",
      "is alien to Islamic teachings, that generations become alien from each other. They find themselves that they have no relationship with each other and this is I mean Islam on the one hand doesn't say that you should worship your ancestors. No there is no such a worship in Islam if ancestors were good you follow them if",
      "them. So Quran has criticized that. Quran says, are they going to follow their forefathers even though they did not use their mind? Even though they were not guided through the right path? So we follow the ancestors if they follow the right thing. Allah SWT has mentioned",
      "So follow the community of Ibrahim a.s. long ago, 4000 years ago. The great ancestor but he emphasized that yes, that is the one because he was the righteous person. We chose him as the right person and he will be the righteous",
      "and do not follow those who are not right. Generation gap came, it's a new phenomena because this came before people used to live together. Multi-generation families in the same household you will find parents children grandparents living close to each other living together",
      "from their grandparents. Grandmothers will tell their stories to their grandchildren. Grandfather will take children out and they will walk with him, and they would tell each other, meet each other and learn from each other. So there was no gap because we were living together. Also mother and father today because of the economic pressures both of them go out and work",
      "except the last few days, a few years because of the COVID. Many people started working from home. Otherwise they were everybody going out and now again it started the same thing. Everybody out early morning they leave. So children very, they do not see much of their parents. According to one survey that was done a few",
      "of communication that was taking place between the parents and children. How can you not have that generation gap if you are dead? The third thing is that, the new philosophy that came with the philosophy of individualism I and me and my rights and my independence, my liberty. That is what's the philosophy that is there. And this again created alienation separation",
      "The only thing that came after that is development of groupism. Everybody has a group, everybody has a caucus, everybody had a party and people follow their party. So young group, teenagers' group, young people's group, old people's groups, seniors' group all these groups. Yes I mean the groups are okay as long as they're functional for the ease of doing things",
      "but not as value, otherwise there is no group. We are all together, we're all human beings, young and old, we all have to work together, care for each other. So groupism creates stereotypes. It created discrimination. It's created if it was a group based on race then it created ethnocentrism. All the other kind of problems that came from this group mentality.",
      "يتكلم عن كل هذه الأشياء وينفع على التواصل بين الجنسات والأهتمام بالجنسة وهذا ما تقصده الإسلام. إن الإسلم يعني أن الناس يجب أن يهتموا مع بعضهم. يهدمون العائلة للحب والمؤمنين لطالبهم ويمكنهم المؤمنون أن يحترموا الزوجين. هذا ما قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في حديث مستقيم جداً",
      "Rasulullah ﷺ said, that is, لَيْسَ مِنَّا مَلَّمْ يُوَقِّرْ كَبِيرًا وَيَرْحَمْ صَغِيرَنَا لَیْسا مِنا He does not belong to us as a Muslim community. And the community of Iman does not belongs to us. The one who does not respect the elder among us and does not care for the young people among us. So young and old both should care for each other. And respect each other and love each other",
      "So those who are, the Quran says, The believers pray, O Lord, give us, grant us from our spouses, from our children, the happiness of our eyes, the coolness of our",
      "Those are the people who will be given, who will granted lofty place because of their steadfastness. And they are going to receive, they will be received with greetings and with peace. And there will be staying in that place forever. What a beautiful place!",
      "It is a beautiful staying place and beautiful for living long time. And Allah says in Surah At-Tur, Those who believe and their families follow them. Their children follow them with Iman.",
      "we bring them together in Jannah. And nobody will be deprived of anything that good they have done. Every person is to his credit whatever he has done. So every person is receiving whatever he's done accordingly. So it is very important that we pay attention to all people, especially our relatives",
      "especially our relatives and especially our elders. Elders are not only seniors, of course seniors you have to pay special attention but elders are all the elders. All the kibar is in general and then also elders of not only of your own family immediate family but it is a large family as well",
      "of the humanity, all people with whom you live. Among whom you leave your neighbors if they're old people whether they belong to another faith but there are older people that have to respect them and care them. And their respect means appreciation. Respect means recognizing whatever they have done in their life. And if they need any help first of all greet them first. Islam emphasizes you greet first the older people. Listen to them, pay attention to what they are saying",
      "If they have some need, take care of their needs. Whether there are physical needs, financial needs and other needs do as much as you can. If they come to someplace and you're sitting stand up. And give them the seat if they want to. If you want to sit there, give them a seat. So this is the way that Rasulullah",
      "عندما يأتي أحدهم للتقابل معه ، فإن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يعطي المكان الأول للمسلمين. عندما تريد أن تتكلم بالنبي الصليم ، قبلة ، قبرة ، دع الشخص الأجر يتكبر ، دفع الشرح إلى الشخاص الأجري يتحدث. هذا ما كان يقوله السيد رحمان الله عز وجل. هذا هو العذر الذي أعطى الإسلام للناس الأغلبية ويجب أن يكون مقدار المجتمع المسلم على هذه الحقائق.",
      "تخلص من جنة إلى جنية لا يوجد فرق بين الجنة وفضلاً نهاراً لنا ونحن بحب بعضنا ويجب أن نطلب الله قال في القرآن هناك عدة مكان لديهم طعام للدعاء للأشخاص الذين كانوا قبلكم",
      "and those who come after them they will say our Lord that those who passed away or those who are older, those who came after them the younger people they'll say Rabbanaqfil lana wal ikhwan inalladheena sabakuna bil iman. Lord forgive us and forgive our brothers who were before us with their Iman and do not let any grudge, any hate, any hardship",
      "Believe, our Lord you are kind and merciful. On the other hand, the Quran mentions the people of hell. The people of Jannah will pray for each other. They will pray those who came before them. And they pray for the people who come after them. But people of Hell, the Qur'an says, Whenever a new group comes, they curse the people before them",
      "who were before them. So that is the style, cursing the previous generation, cursin' the elders and criticizing them too much. There's nothing wrong to criticize but with respect and if it is right to do that, but also you have to do it in such a way, cursinging, saying all kind of bad things about, that is something that Muslims have to avoid that. So we should emphasize",
      "the communication between generations. And that will come by having as much as possible living together with our elders, taking care of elders, meeting with them, taking our children. Nowadays, alhamdulillah, many families have their parents here. About 40-50 years ago people used to refer to their parents back home",
      "ونحن الآن الحمد لله أنهم هناك معظم العائلات التي لديها هناك لذا فإنه مهم جداً التواصل معهم إنه مهما كان من المفترض أن يكونوا باقي حقوق ونعم هناك بعض الأشياء سوف تكون بعض الشعبين أصغرون بعض الوقت لا سيتحدثون معكم ولا سيعرفونكم ولا تعلمونهم ولكن الله سبحانه وتعالى قال ذلك",
      "Your Lord has determined, your Lord has commanded that you worship none except Allah and be good to your parents. If one of them or both of them get old and you are there then you have to treat them nicely.",
      "Don't even say off to them. Don't rebuke them, don't be harsh towards them. So don't say off so don't shout at them and it's a good word",
      "Lord have mercy on them. They raised me when I was little. So that is the kind of treatment, that is a kind of relationship Islam emphasizes between the young and old. Remember every one of us has to learn. And learning is not just education, not going to university and getting the degree. Learning is",
      "You learn the basic skills, but at the same time you have to have moral training. The moral upbringing for yourself and your children. And tazkiyah, spiritual training. So ta'aleem, tarbiyah and tazkia these are three things that are very important in education in Islam. May Allah guide us and keep us on the right path. And give us understanding of our faith",
      "so that those people who are standing can find a place inshallah give some room the first give some rooms for others and then Allah will make room for you as well in the Jannah",
      "Religion is something that is given to us when you talk about Islam, given to all by Allah and his Messenger. Religion has permanent values. Most of the religious values are permanent values they don't change. Those values have to be followed. It doesn't make any difference whether they were 100 years ago 200 years ago or 1000 years ago it doesn't matter if they were in Arabia or India or Pakistan",
      "in any other country. So religious values don't change because of the place, because of time. Culture is different. Culture has human development. People have it in different countries and regions at different times. They are a different kind of culture. So cultures change. Some culture is good and some culture is not good. If it's good, accept it regardless where from you're from.",
      "is bad and not everything that you had from the old culture back home was good. So, you have to be careful selective as far as religion follows the religion sometimes people mix between culture and religion so this distinction is very important",
      "acceptable, they're not good but there are a lot of things that are acceptable because they are religious values and one of them is the respect of the elders. That is a permanent value and it is the value of religion that will not change because of the change of culture and we have to live by that. But at the same time it is important to give independence to our children listen to them be respectful to them",
      "to them. Sometimes they may say things that may not be what we generally know, but if it is right, fine. And make them, help them to learn and grow so that they become the leaders. That's why Ali, radiallahu anhu, used to say, akrimu wala dhakum wa ahsanu adabahum fa innahum khuliqul zamanin ghair zamanikum. Honor your children",

      "Man-made disasters, problems in Kashmir, in Palestine, in Yemen. Problems in the people of Burma, Rohingya. Problem for the people Muslims of China and many other places. May Allah Almighty remove all those suffering and all this pain and make this coming year inshallah a blessed year for the ummah and for the humanity at large.",
      "at large the time is moving time is very fast it doesn't stop keep on moving day by day so we have to be conscious of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and be aware of every moment of our life may allah keep these moments precious moments good moments you know there",
      "We all know it by heart. The Sahaba, whenever they gather and then they leave each other, they used to remind. Recite this surah. And by the time we translate the word as time",
      "but it is really not time because for time you have waqt, you have zaman,you have dahar. But asr is the passing time, the declining time like the asr time. The asr times are when the day is gone most of the days gone now it's just a little time left until ghurub. Asr is",
      "juice that has taken out from the food so as it is the passing time declining time and allah makes that time at the testimony of the witness be conscious of that the human beings have been in loss",
      "ہمارے جو انسان ہیں کاملوں کیا لہذا کہ وہ اپنی وقت کو صحیح طرح استعمال کرنا چاہتے ہیں ،",
      "each other about haqqa. Haqq is the truth, haqqu is the reality and haq is rights of the people. Al-haqq huwa Allah And haq q is what we are supposed to do. A'ati kullazi haq in haqka as the Prophet said. And then also there are hukooq. We have to recognize the hukook of other people.",
      "So they remind each other about haq and they remind one another about patience, being steadfast. Firm on your principles and patiently bear the challenges and difficulties. Imam Shafi' is reported to have said this short surah contains what",
      "اگر لوگ اسے دیکھتے ہیں تو ان کے لئے تفریق کریں گے یہ انہوں نے سمجھا جائے گا۔ وہ ان کے بارے میں کافی ہوگا۔ لہذا مسلمان حضرت صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کی حجر سے محسوس رکھنے والے ہیں۔ عام 622 معاملہ عورت ہے حجرا کا نمبر ایک اور ہم اس وقت کو کہنا چاہتے",
      "It was this moment, this time was selected by the Sahaba with the consensus during the time of Umar. And there is great meaning in that because the significance of the Hijrah of the Prophet is that Islam before that in Mecca it was a message, it was preaching but now when it moved from Mecca to Medina",
      "It became a culture, a civilization, a government, a state. That's what Islam became. Hijrah, as you know is the Arabic word it has two meanings. One meaning is migration from one land to another land, from one place to another place and that is general understanding of the word hijrah",
      "But other meaning is moving from one condition to another condition. Actually, from the bad condition to better condition. So hijrah is moving form one condition into another condition and Islam is the way of Hijra. The whole Islam is a way of hijrah.",
      "every day we have to make hijrah you know the rasulullah in his last khutbah and he performed hajj and at that time he gave a khutba imam ahmed bin hamad reports that he spoke to the com to the community to the believers who are sitting in front of him and he asked them do you know manil moment do you",
      "اور پھر وہ کہا ہے مومن ایک طور پر مومین اللہ کے بارے میں صحابت کرتا ہے اس کی رسول اللہ کو انجلوں سے جب کام ہوتی ہے اس دن آخر میں اس کا معمولی یہ ہے جو ایمان کی تصور ہے لیکن مومی نے ایک خاص قسم ہے ممنون ایک نخلاق",
      "People trust him. People trust that Momin, believer man or woman with their money and with their lives a true believer will not harm. He will not fraud them and commit wrong to the people. Well Muslim do you know Manil Muslim? Do you know who is Muslim? And then the Prophet said",
      "مسلمان ایک ہاتھ اور اس کے لئے دنیا میں بھی آسان ہیں اور پھر وہ کہتا ہے کیا آپ جانتے ہو مجاہد کو جان رہی ہے جو مجاجد ہے اور پہلے حضور صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے کہا کہ مجائد نفس فطاعت اللہ کا منجاحد ہے مجاد یہ ایک شخص ہے جس سے انہوں نے خود کے ساتھ جهاد کرنا اور اس کی دماغ اللہ تعالیٰ کی عبادت کے لیے",
      "because this nafs is very difficult to control and put the nafs into the right way to the obedience of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that is a big task",
      "Muhajir is the one who leaves things that Allah has forbidden. So there is hijrah, my brothers and sisters, every day. Hijrah from kufr to iman. Hijarah from shirk to tawheed. Hijrahr from isyaan to ta'a.",
      "صحیحت کے لئے ہجرہ ہے۔ اور ہجرا اللہ سے رضوان اللہ کو جاتا ہے۔ یہ ہجری ہے۔ اسلام ہجرت کا طرف ہے۔ سب سے بڑھنگنے کی طرف ہجمت ہے۔",
      "جب انہیں یہ وقت کو ایک مهم وقت کیا تھا اور اس کے لئے بڑی وقت ہے کہ ہر سال میں ہماری دنیا کو تکلیف کرنا چاہتا ہے۔ وہ تھوڑا وقت تھا۔ اور حجر کا صلاح صدام تھا اس کی زندگی میں ایک ضروری وقعی ووقعت تھا ، یہ ایک مشکل وقت، اچھا وقوع تھا کہ خود کے پاس رہنے والے انسانوں نے اسے قتل کرنا ڈالنا چیز تھا",
      "اس حال میں جب وہ کھانے کے لئے ہوا تھا تو انہیں چلتی ہے۔ لیکن رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کی طرف ، رسو اللہ سبحانہ وتعالیٰ نے اپنے بچوں کو علیؒ اللہ عنہ سے گھر دیا جاتا ہے اور پھر نبی صلوٰی صلاة والسلام اسے کیوں کہا کہ اسے کرنا چاہئے",
      "Seerah, they say because the Prophet ﷺ used to have some Wadaya. So they think that were entrusted to him. They belong to the people of Mecca. Even though the people sent a group of people to assassinate him but Rasulullah did not want to go without returning the Amanah of the people to them and that is the reason he asked his cousin to sleep there for dangerous moment but Allah said that Allah will protect you",
      "Allah will protect you. And Ali, peace be upon him, believed that. He had full trust in that. And then he, that's what he did soon after that and then after that he joined the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon his soul, and met him in Medina. So taking care of the people even the enemies because what the Prophet said as Anas, peace",
      "Rasulullah gave us a khutbah and he did not say that. He has no Iman, who is not trustworthy? Who does not keep the Amanah? And there is no Deen. That person has no Dein, no religion! The one who does not",
      "ہمارے ناموں میں جوہر ہے اور وہاں ہمیں دین ہے لہذا حجرہ اگر پروفیس اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم بہت مهم ہے کہ ہم اس کے توجہ سے اعتماد کرتے ہیں۔ ہم اللہ سبحانہ وتعالیٰ کو ایک خوبصورت سن کے لئے ہجرا کی نیا عمر کرنا چاہتے رہتا ہے",

      "companion the two were in the cave and he said to his companion grieve not indeed allah is with us then allah sent down his peace upon him and strengthen him with forces which you saw not and humble to the depth the word of the unbelievers but the word",
      "So, hijrah of the Prophet ﷺ tells us, لا تحزن إن الله معنا. Grieve not, Allah is with us. Whatever the circumstances, whatever the challenges, keep to the right path, Allah will help us and protect us.",

      "Hello! I'm going to show you how to make a beautiful, easy-to-make cake.",
      "And we can get started with our program.",
      "in the month of Rajab and more so, in this month we are reminded of that miraculous night journey known as Israa and Mi'rad. So to discuss more about that we are in the virtual company of Dr Siddiqui welcome to you how are you this evening sir? Alhamdulillah thank you very much Allah bless you. Amen. Dr Sidiqi let's begin by talking a little bit about",
      "share some of the relevant etymology of this word and then explain to us why the month of Rajab has a special place on the Islamic calendar. Thank you, Safi.",
      "The month of Rajab is the seventh month of the Islamic lunar calendar. The months according to the lunar cycle and it is one of the sacred months, one of blessed months. The word Rajab means honor, honorable month",
      "Allah says in Surah At-Tawbah The number of months according to Allah from the day He created heaven and earth are 12 months.",
      "of the 12 months there are four months that are sacred months these months were recognized by the arabs before accepting islam before receiving the message of islam that there are some sacred months and in this month they would not fight they would have battles so the months were reserved for journey freely without any fear",
      "and they would spend this time in worship, in doing good things. Three months come together, Dhul Qaeda, Dhil Hajjah, and Muharram, 11th, 12th, and the first month of Muharrama. So these three months come togther. In the month of Dhul qaeda they will travel, in the month dhul hajja they perform hajj, and in the moth of Muharram they will return to their homes. So everybody can do things in a very safe manner",
      "manner now the month of rajab comes between jumada and shaaban so this month was also special they would recognize it with the worship some of them they used to go even for umrah during this time so it was an honorable month it was a respectable month",
      "and said do not do wrong things do not go wrong things anytime any month but since you recognize these four months uh also observe don't fight when if you don't find it's good anytime when you recognize say this four months so at this time don't do that",
      "this month of Rajab and the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam emphasized that, the Arabs they had another custom. That sometimes they would change the months if they wanted to have some fight with some tribe, they will say month of rajab will come later. So they delay the month of raja postpone it",
      "and sometimes they will have intercalation. That means add the days in the month, and to make it coincide synchronize with solar calendar or these kinds of things were happening mixing up in their calendar different tribes were doing that except the one tribe of Mudar",
      "they would keep the Rajab as it is in their own. Because there was no universal calendar, so each tribe had its own way of understanding. So month of Rajab was kept by the tribe of Mudar as it Is. So that's why it was called also Rajab Mudar, Rajab of Mudal. That means that is the month that is fixed and its own time. That is the one that Rasulullah spoke about that, Rajb Mudar.",
      "Nasee was a problem that existed at the time Allah SWT mentioned that, Innamal nasee wa ziyadatun min al-kufr. Nasea is part of the days of disbelief, of the day of ignorance that they were doing. Islam did not accept nasi. Islam said the month should remain as they are according to the way Allah SWt has created and Rasulullah announced that in his last hajj",
      "and he said the time has moved and it is now every month in its own place as Allah created heaven and earth so now don't change that keep it that way so Alhamdulillah from that time, from the time of the Prophet, Rajab, Shaaban, Ramadan all of them come according to their own time. So Rajab is respected by Muslims also",
      "There is no special dua or prayer or fasting in this month. But some people do that because they are sacred months, so you can do that. But there is nothing emphasized and recommended that you must do that it is up to you.",
      "the 27th of Rajab and the 27 th of Rajj is generally recognized as the day or the night of the 27 rajab, which is the night in which the Isra'il Mirage took place. Although there are some other dates also given so there is no unanimity on that but most people recognize that it was the night",
      "dua or prayer for that night and there is no fasting especially mentioned for that but if people want to fast, if you want to make dua they can do anytime. Thank you Dr Siddiqui set the scene for us now if you will what was happening in Makkah at that time? Briefly explain to us what were some of the circumstances that led up to such a phenomenal event",
      "Rasulullah when he started preaching his message there was a lot of opposition people did not want to give up idol worship their traditional religion their tribal religion tribal way of life they didn't want to",
      "those who had difficulty, they accepted. But there were many leaders of Mecca, they opposed the Prophet. So he went through a lot of difficulties at that time. Early followers were persecuted. They went through great hardship and Rasulullah had support of his uncle Abu Talib and also support of",
      "from prominent families of Mecca and they had their influence so the people of Meccan were persecuting, recreating problems but at the same time they recognized Abu Talib, Khadija radiyaAllahu ta'ala anha and did not physically harm the Prophet. But then Abu Talab was an old person. He died",
      "in his old age and after that within a few weeks or few months after that uh haditha passed away so this was a personal loss for the prophet sallallahu alaihi was aggrieved",
      "him to present the message of Islam to the people. The Meccans became bold in opposing the Prophet and hurting the Prophet. So Rasulullah was looking for some other place where he could go because his work is for Allah, his place is important, Makkah is important but again if it is not possible",
      "would go and find some other place so Rasulullah left Makkah and went all the way to Taif. Taif is a hill town about 50 miles from Makkah, and some of the rich people prosperous people of Makkah they live there because the climate is cooler especially in summertime and so they used to spend their time there",
      "them might listen to him and pay attention to his message. And he spoke to the leadership there, but they did not listen. They refused to listen to Him. Actually, they even asked some young people that chase him out, let him leave the city. So they started chasing the Prophet, throwing stones",
      "and Rasulullah was wounded. His blessed feet were wounded, and the blood was coming out from there. So Rasulallah left the city and he took rest in an orchard in a small garden of palm trees and grapes. So",
      "dua very moving dua in which he mentioned allah may ashku ilaika dafa quwati and the people for me but you are the most merciful to you i complain all of this and then in the end he says that uh",
      "to my enemies, to those who are going to... Who have overpowering me. But then if you are not angry with me I do not care. If you are angry with like al-udba hatta tarda You should be pleased with me. I want that you approve me and you please be pleased me. So Rasulullah made this dua",
      "was a young servant of the owner of the garden he was watching the prophet and uh he brought some grapes from the from the garden and presented them to the prophet uh rasulullah took one of the grapes and he said bismillah adas or the man who presented that",
      "when he said Bismillahirrahmanirrahim in the name of Allah, the most merciful, the compassionate. Adas said who are you? Your people I mean the people here they don't say that so what who are You where from are You? So the Prophet asked him what about You? You said that your people as if You are not from here in this area so where what about you? He said I am from Nineveh",
      "and the Prophet said oh that is the city of my brother Yunus, Yunus alaihi salam so he said how do you know Yunus people here they don't know and the prophet said he was a prophet of Allah and I am the prophet of law so Adas at that moment fell down and he kissed the feet of the Prophet",
      "and his master saw him from distance, and he asked Adas what happened? What were you doing? He said there is no one better than him on the face of the earth. So you see that the leadership of Taif refused to listen to him but there was someone who",
      "But there was someone who recognized his greatness and his high place, the respect and honor. And then Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam moved from there and came to Makkah. The situation was very difficult there. The Prophet Sallaallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam came to Mecca and Allah saw his difficulties",
      "and his dua to Allah. And Allah says in the Quran, difficulty come easy, difficulty comes easy. So Rasulullah had this experience of Isra' and Mi'raj in that kind of situation. It's a beautiful and great miracle that happened. And this was to show the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam Allah's signs",
      "that mission is not going to fail. Mission is going to succeed, the message is going reach all different places and there are many other incidents that happened during this time but this is just a summary of the condition of Makkah and what was happening at that time. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we're going to move on to the main segment of our talk this evening. Go ahead post your questions in the chat box at any time. Dr Siddiqui with",
      "dikki with that very heart-rendering backdrop we are now all going to join you for a virtual tour describe for us the details of that remarkable night journey when rasulallah was transported through the seven heavens and beyond thank you yes this is a beautiful story it is a long story so not",
      "tell you all the details but there are several segments. The first one is the Prophet going from Mecca to Jerusalem and the Quran says from Masjid al-Haram to Masjids al-Aqsa. Second thing is the prophet was going from Jerusalem to the heavens, ascension of the prophet.",
      "from Jerusalem to heaven. The first is called Isra, night journey from Makkah to Jerusalem that's Isra and the second is Mi'raj that is ascension from Jerusalem into heaven. And both of these events happened miraculously in a very short time in one night, in the same night. So he was taken",
      "from Masjid Al Haram. Some stories say that he also his chest was open which is called Shaq al Sadr and his heart was washed so this is like a preparation for his blessed journey and also it's going to be in the audience of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala. It's a total cleanness of the body inside and outside,",
      "was his companion and jibril came and he presented to him a special conveyance this is the celestial animal that is called buraq burak is described that is smaller than a mule",
      "a medium-sized horse and speed is very fast it's like a speed of light that's what we call buraq barque is light so the speed of flight 186 000 miles per second and even more than that so that is uh the speed",
      "in Jerusalem and Rasulullah arrived the city of Jerusalem to the place where there was the masjid of Dawud alaihis salam, the old masjids that were established long time before that by Ibrahim alaihi salam and then Dawud. So we'll talk about that so there near the Masjid Al-Aqsa",
      "tied his the brock at one of the uh the rings was a door he tied his block and then after that he went and he was happy to see many prophets of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala maybe all the prophets of",
      "him to welcome him and he they asked him to lead the prayer in the last prophet of allah subhanahu ta'ala uh the final messenger of allahu and he is was given this honor to be the imam of the prophets of all so he led them in prayer and after he finished the prayer",
      "came to him and presented him two cups. One was with milk, the other was a cup of wine. Wine at that time was not haram because this is before the hijrah of the Prophet from Mecca to Medina. It became haram when the Prophet came to Medinah later. So he presented",
      "to him two cups and gave him the choice select whatever cup you want to take for your to drink and Rasulullah accepted the cup of milk and refused the cup wine at that time Jibreel made a remark he said",
      "path, the path of purity and goodness. And so will be your Ummah, your community, your followers they will be. So Ummah is the Ummah of Fitrah. We follow the path pure and authentic and clean nature. And wine is Umm al-Khabaiz. Wine is the mother of evils.",
      "without any instruction, without any order from Allah SWT. He himself inside had the fitrah so he rejected that and it became of course forbidden, haram to drink alcohol all type of alcohol not just wine all types of alcohol any intoxicant is forbidden for Muslims to have that So here Rasulullah took this fresh good milk and he was ready for further",
      "further journey and then he was presented mirage mirage is a kind of a ladder a celestial miraculous ladder and that was presented to him in one of the hadiths the prasad said this is something that at the time of when the soul departs of human being soul depart from the body a person sees something",
      "That is what he sees, especially a believer. So that's kind of a letter. The eyes move towards heaven and I said that is what was presented to me. He went on this letter and Jibreel was with him and arrived at the first heaven. There are seven heavens mentioned in the Quran.",
      "the layer upon layers of course long distance between one heaven to another heaven but these are seven heavens the full nature of them only a note to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala but mention that so he came to uh and then there is uh there are prophets who welcome him and you receive him these are like his reception people were they are ready",
      "Adam was there, the first human being. He received him and he said welcome to a pious son and a piety prophet, a great prophet. And he welcomed him and recognized his prophethood.",
      "and then he found that Jesus, peace be upon him, and Yahya alayhis salam his cousin both of them were there to receive the Prophet salallahu alaihi wasalam. And they also said that they said marhaban bil nabiyy as-saleh Adam alayis salam is of course the father of everyone so he says father i mean son but as far as Isa alayi salam",
      "and they recognized his prophethood. And then the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam moved to the third heaven, and there he found Yusuf Alayhi Salam most beautiful, most handsome person and great prophet of Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la in the family of Yaqub Alayhis Salaam So he received the Prophet and also said Welcome to a pious prophet",
      "pious prophet, the great Prophet. And then he moved to the fourth heaven and on the fourth Heaven it is mentioned that he met Ilyas, Elijah, a great prophet of Allah. He was raised already in the highest rank. Then he moved",
      "Prophet was received by Harun. So prophet Aaron, a great prophet of Allah who was the brother of Musa and who was supporter of Musas. And his mission was the same as the mission of Musan. So Harun received the Prophet,",
      "And there was Musa himself. And Musa also received him and honored him and recognized his prophethood. And then after that, the Prophet went to seventh heaven. And that is the highest heaven. There was Ibrahim, Abu al-Anbiya, the father of many prophets of Allah. He received him, and he also said marhaban bin nabiyy as salih wal ibni as saliha",
      "welcome to a great prophet the pious prophet and a pious son because he is the prophet muhammad within the family of ibrahim through his son ismail so ibrahim called him an al-ibn the sun and also the the prophet of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala after that",
      "that is the ultimate boundary. That is a boundary, Allah says,. That is the place where there is Jannah. And then so Prophet went there and then beyond that of this boundary, Jibreel said now you proceed. This is my limit.",
      "Jibrail Alayhi Salaam is still there. And he was taken now towards the audience with Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala and Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la spoke to him, and Allah said",
      "and uh allah revealed to him for oh reveal to him whatever he will he revealed to the mysteries of the heaven and the earth he showed him the whole universe the creation whatever is going on he showed",
      "He saw the greatest signs of Allah. And with all that, then he was given two gifts. Special gift of Allah One of them is the last two ayat of Surah Al-Baqarah. So these two ayats were given especially",
      "especially in that the presence of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that's why rasulallah said who's ever recite these two ayat before going to bed and before sleeping they will be sufficient for him they will bring him blessings of allahu and these are great ayats",
      "Lord, don't hold us accountable if you mistake. If we make mistakes by forgetfulness. So that was a great gift from Allah SWT, special dua",
      "that is given, that talks about our belief and then our devotion to Allah. Our supplication to Allah And then Allah told him that you and your Ummah should pray, make Salat every day. So obligation of Salat was given at that time. And he was told to pray 50 times every day",
      "your ummah should pray 50 times every day. And of course Rasulullah is the most obedient servant of Allah, Muslim was the one who submit to Allah. He did not say anything. He accepted that and he returned with this 50 prayers. So he passed by Ibrahim again, Hanifan Muslima",
      "did not ask too many questions, but Musa is very inquisitive person. So Musa said what happened? And what did you receive? Did you get anything? And he mentioned that Allah gave me 50 prayers. Musa Alayhi Salaam said I have experience of Bani Israel, very difficult people so I asked you to go back",
      "and ask allah to reduce the number because my people could not do it and i don't think you will people can do that so it will be difficult so go rasulullah asked you jibrail should i go and jibril said yes",
      "and so the prayers were made 40. 10 pairs were taken away and said all right you do 40 prayers and Rasulullah went back left and came and Musa asked again and he said no you have to go and ask more reduction so he went uh back and forth back and",
      "and he came back and he said to musa alaihi salam five prayers musa there is still too much go and ask for less and the prophet said i'm shy i'm embarrassed to go and asked again so then he heard a voice coming from heaven from above and the wise hand on zaito faridati this is the obligation",
      "but I reduce for my servants and these are five prayers, but the reward will be 50. My word will not change. I said 50 to every 50, but reward will 50, But you'll have five prayers. So what an honor? And again, you can see that here Musa his experience",
      "that Allah SWT gave him back and forth, coming again and again to Allah SWTA. And then say to Him that this will be the reward. So prayer is very important. Prayer was given from above, from heaven. All the orders came to earth but the prayers came when Prophet SAW was in heaven.",
      "my obligation is there and you have to do that so five prayers we perform and the reward will be 50 prayers if they are done in the right way it's a blessing, it's an honor and Rasulullah accepted that but of course in his life he did not pray 50 times but he prayed more than 50 rak'ah every day",
      "He used to pray 17 rakah fard, 12 rakah sunnah. And then he also used to do vitr prayer 3 rakahs and he used to make tahajjud prayer 8 rakah and he use to make ishraq prayer 8 raka and he uses to have tahiyyat al-masjid and other nawafil so if you put them all together they are more than 50 and he loved the prayers",
      "he said my coolness of my eyes happiness of my heart is in the salah so salat is very important and we have to pay attention to salad salat this has said is mirage of the believers it is the ascension of the",
      "And after that, the Prophet was shown in the area. He was shown heaven and Jannah. Then also he passed by and he was shown hellfire. So heaven and hell are there. Creators of Allah were shown to the Prophet.",
      "will happen to those who turn away from the right path so that is the heaven and hell and then the prophet was brought back to jerusalem and then from there he came back uh to mecca so that",
      "different in different reports but this is a generally accepted sequence that i gave you so this is the itinerary of rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam um that is generally accepted by uh the writers of the seerah of the prophet thank you dr sadiki this information no matter how many times we review with you i'm sure each one",
      "But tell us now Dr. Siddiqui, how did the word spread in Makkah that the Prophet had experienced such a journey? And what was the reaction of certainly the kuffar of Makkah but what was also the reaction from the believers? Were there skeptics amongst them? The Prophet, of course, in the morning he told people what happened to him and",
      "and Abu Jahl was also there. And he said, oh that's what you are saying? He said yes. Say can I bring people? So he brought people and some of them were disbelievers, some of the Muslims although. So those who were strong in their faith they said of course we accept that",
      "But those who were weak in their faith and those who are disbelievers, they ridiculed him. And Abu Bakr was a great companion of the Prophet. He was one of the first people who accepted Islam. Abu Bakri was told when he came and asked the Prophet, said, is this true Messenger of Allah? Is this what you're telling?",
      "then he said i believe that i believe something more than that i believed that allah sent you the message from heaven every now and then so if allah send you to heaven message from haven allah can take you there and and and show you the place so he accepted that and then uh abu bakr radiallahu anhu said",
      "could you describe something of Jerusalem so that other people hear? And so Rasulullah described the area. And Abu Bakr said, yes, yes you're right this is exactly and this is the way how it is. And the Prophet called him Siddique. So he became Abu Bakar as Siddiqu. The title of Abu Bakir was given to him.",
      "for the disbelievers. It became a fitna for some people, that means trial for them but it was a confirmation of faith for the believers and it gave them hope that the message is going to reach all over and the message will not fail even though there were persecutions",
      "and their difficulties, but Islam is going to spread. So we can learn many lessons from this. Thank you. Dr. Siddiqui in the beginning, you mentioned some cultural practices that take place during this month just briefly any do's and don'ts and any harm in any of the practices? And there are people who say that there is a special prayer",
      "prayer which they call it salat al-ragaib. Salat al ra gaib, our scholars say has no basis so they say the first Friday of the month of Rajab you should have a special prayer and fast that is on Thursday and then after that in that night you pray and that has no",
      "people say it is recommended that you must make umrah during rajab. Again, it is not in any authentic hadith that you make umra of Rajab especially having some special celebration of the night of Rajb, of the Night of Isra and Mi'raj. That is also not mentioned. Of course,",
      "many lessons and they are very significant lessons, very important lessons. But having special prayers our scholars say if you want to pray, pray but not say that this is the prayer of that night because we should not make our religion according to our own wishes it has to be according to the way that we are given to us by the Prophet, by the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet.",
      "Thank you. Do you have any other cultural practice that you have in mind? Not that I know of, no. I didn't grow up with any cultural practices myself but Allah bless you Dr Siddiqui and give us the understanding to dwell upon the lessons. Ladies and gentlemen if you have",
      "May we join you for a closing du'a, sir? Alhamdulillah. One thing just let me mention about the relationship between Mecca and Jerusalem because Jerusalem is a very important place, very important city and area of Masjid al-Aqsa is a",
      "Muslims should understand the significance of Jerusalem, significance of Masjid al-Aqsa and pay full attention to that. And you know Ibrahim had two sons Yaqub, Ishaaq and Isma'il.",
      "and the other son Ismail in Mecca. And there, the two centers were there. And these centers existed and other prophets of Allah came. And then came Rasulullah. And his going from Mecca to Jerusalem indicates that now there is merging of the two. That means the mission of Rasulallah includes both cities, Mecca and Jerusalem.",
      "And it is now all the prophets of Allah and Rasulullah they were all together. It's one message, one group, one mission that is the significance of his bringing him from Makkah to Jerusalem and then from Jerusalem going to heaven. So it is important very important to keep that in mind the significance",
      "Muslims historical significance as well as religious significance for us it is part of our aqeedah we cannot give it up. We have to keep out in our mind and our understanding and understand that, that we have to pay full attention to this city and to this masjid and the masjids they should not neglect. Thank you. Mr. Siddiqui closing du'a from you?",
      "we pray to you to remove the difficulties of people from everywhere everywhere and especially",
      "of israel and maharaj will remove their difficulty and their pain and those who are suffering in other places other having receiving and the other difficulties allah help us help us on the right keep us on"

      "are its preserver, it's protector. Zikr is one of the names of the Quran. Allah says in the Quran that we send down the zikr to you so that you may explain to the people what is revealed for them",
      "Zikr has two meanings. One meaning of zikr is remembrance, and the other meaning is reminder. So Quran is an excellent book of zikhra. If you want to do the zikhrah of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala read Quran. That's the best zikhah. It is a zikhir for you and for your people.",
      "people and Quran is also a book of reminders it reminds about Allah, it's reminds about the prophets of Allah. It reminds about teachings of the prophets throughout history and it reminds you about life here how you should live your life here and life hereafter",
      "It's a great zikr, great reminder. And Allah sent books before the Quran, Torah and Injeel and Zubur. Those books are there but they are not fully authentic. They were changed, they were distorted. But Allah guarantees that",
      "that the Quran will not be changed and Quran will never be destroyed. Quran will remain as it was revealed to Prophet Muhammad forever. But there are people who tried in the time of the Prophet to destroy the Quran, and after that they tried to destroy",
      "And Quran we have today is the same Quran that was given to Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. Last more than 1400 years, nobody was able to change anything from the Quran. Even a word of the Quran would not change because it is written and because it's in the hearts of the people. Millions and millions",
      "millions of people, they know the whole Quran by heart. And it is recited by billions of people and it will continue that way inshallah. So it's a book that is preserved. Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala has said it very emphatically",
      "Three times Allah says, we revealed it and we are going to protect it. Who can challenge Allah? Recently a group of people in different western capitals they tried to burn the copies of the Quran",
      "that is going on. It's shocking, it is very insulting, it makes us very sad and worried but we have trust in Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala and we have to do our job, our job is to take care of the Quran to our capacity and Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la of course will take care out. So they are trying you know that about 2010",
      "there was a pastor in Florida who announced that he's collecting many copies of the Quran and he will try to burn them in public, and he would do that every year. In the remembrance of 9-11. He failed! We don't know where he has gone. He is gone but Alhamdulillah Quran is still here. So Quran is",
      "Quran is a special book of Allah. It's a very special book, and we are honored that we believe in it And we love it. It is dear to our hearts In one of the sayings of the Prophet, it was mentioned that Allah says I am giving you a book that water cannot wash it away",
      "fire cannot burn it. The meaning of that is, as Ibn al-Kasir said,",
      "of Siri says it is because the Quran is preserved in the chests of people, in the hearts of the people. It is easy to pronounce, it is easy read on the tongues so people have different languages nothing to do with Arabic very far away from Arabic but still they pronounce",
      "Some of the great reciters of the Quran are from non-Arabic countries. China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, all of these. Not just Arab countries. Arab countries and then others. Pakistan, India, and other places all over the world. And the Quran captures the hearts of the people.",
      "people. It has captured the hearts of the people, the humanity. People from all over the world they love it. They want to listen to it hours and hours and hour,s and they never get tired of it. Read a book in Chinese and ask people to stand an hour to listen? To it I mean Chinese people will stand but not other people. But read the Quran and you will see people",
      "The month of Ramadan is coming and you will see that all over the world. And this happened, people read it, whole night people read It. So this is the miracle of the Quran Any book in any other language, any foreign language You cannot read it many times, you cannot listen to it for a long time and again and again But it is the Miracle of the Qur'an That the more you listen to It, the more You like It,",

      "It is a decisive word. It is not a joke. It's not just. If any tyrant, any wrongdoer will leave the Quran Allah will break it back and if anyone seek guidance from",

      "And pay more attention to this book. It is a sad moment to see the people burning the book and why they are doing it? They are doing, some people are atheists, they don't care for any book, for any holy book and Some people are doing that as Islamophobia Because they want to create hate against Islam",
      "increase hate crimes against Muslims. So that's why all of us have to be very concerned about that. We should condemn it, we should speak against it and we should invite people to be civilized, to have the civilized behavior not do it against Muslims or not do that against anyone because Muslims even though they are I mean Torah and Injil we believe in them",
      "we don't believe that they are in their authentic form but there are many things in them that are good and still if even if you don't accept everything we respect and the other religions hinduism and buddhism and jainism and daoism and others even though we don' t accept that but it's still we respect people's right to believe in whatever they believe and respect their books allah says even about",

      "and rules, and civilization. Even in the same countries where they were burning their copies of the Quran in the presence of police when somebody burned the Torah, they stopped that. The police has stopped that so it is not just freedom of speech. They also have to understand that hypocrisy. So it is discrimination.",
      "It is Islamophobia. So what we have to do, that is, we take the Quran seriously. A'tasimu bi kitabillah. Hold the book of Allah very fast. Stick to the book and love the book. Read it every day especially in the month of Ramadan pay attention to the Book of Allah because month of Ramadhan",

And the message of the Quran should be given to the people. This message is universal message. It talks about universal God, not just tribal god. Universal God Allah.",

      "The spirit is from the breath of our Lord, the creator. And this is called Ruh in Arabic or the Hebrew word Ruah.",
      "bow down before him. From dark mud, from clay God made a being and his breath made even angels to bow down. The nature of the spirit is not easy to understand. The Quran says they ask you concerning rooh say O prophet it is part of my Lord's domain and you have been given of knowledge only little",
      "Body and spirit have a very interesting combination.",
      "Spirit gives life, dignity and honor to the body. Spirit integrates and unites. Body divides and separates. We cannot ignore our bodies. We have to take care of the needs of the body by proper food, exercise, rest etc.",
      "We are born in particular families, societies and cultures. And we have our belongings and commitments. There are some traditions that say spirit cannot rise above unless the body is put down. You have to get rid of desires and bones of the body. Then your body and spirit will be released from the bones of flesh",
      "the flesh, then and only you can rise above. To care for the spirit they say you must renounce the needs of your body, you must mortify your body leave the family business and community. Islamic tradition says your body has a right on you and at the same time it says you have to take care of your spirit. The virtue is that which",
      "which is good for the body and spirit both. The sin harms the body, and the spirit both.\" Just as the body needs nourishing, so does the spirit. Quest for the nourishment of the spirit is a common theme in religions. It is essential to solve many problems that we human beings face every day. Without nurturing the spirit, we cannot solve the problems of greed, hate",
      "hate and violence. Many problems that human beings are facing today are not because of lack of physical or material resources, the main problem is poverty and malnourishment of the spirit. So we are discussing a real subject very much needed how to nurture and nourish the spirit? Islam teaches that the spirit cannot be nurtured",
      "and nourish unless it is connected to its source. This needs three things, sincere faith, purity, and charity. Hypocrisy corrupts the spirit. Sincere faith and sincere relation with God enhances the spirit The lifestyle must be pure and good. One should avoid sins of lust, pride, and greed. Charity means kindness",
      "wishing for others what one wishes for oneself. The Quran and the prophetic teachings abound on that. We have several important terms that we use, one of the very strong terms from those of you familiar with that is Rabbaniyya, that means godliness, become godly people.",
      "and goodness in your life. Purification and growth, continuously purify yourself and grow. So nurturing the spirit means linking the spirit to its source, becoming conscious of God. Islam teaches that human personality has its outward aspect and inward aspect. Unless the inward is good, the outward cannot be reformed.",
      "Jesus, peace be upon him, is reported to have said, criticizing some people, Woe to you teachers of the law. You hypocrites. You cleanse the outside of the cup and dish but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Matthew chapter 23. Prophet Muhammad taught us to pray Lord make my inward better than my outward and make my outward righteous.",
      "So, spirit, heart and soul are all the inner dimensions of human beings. Very often we ignore these inner dimensions and outward dominates the inward and corrupts the inward. The Quran mentions three modalities or characteristics of the human soul.",
      "This is the aspect of the soul that instigates human beings to evil. It may be translated as lower soul or appetitive soul. It is the inner locus of immoderate desires and fiery passions. Some call it sensuous or sensual. The second modality is called a nafsulawwama, or the blaming soul.",
      "It refers to that aspect of the soul which blames or criticizes itself, and becomes aware of its own evil and challenges. It is the locus of moral consciousness. This is rational ego. This what philosophers call aql, reason or intellect. The third modality is called an-nafs al mutmainah",
      "or the contented soul, the soul in which the turbulences of desires and passions have been calmed down leading to peace and tranquility. This is also called Al Qalb al Saleem, the pure and sound heart. It is the threshold of the divine dimension of being. It's the nurtured spirit. The true and authentic personality begins not from outward appearances but from inward purity and growth",
      "Nurturing the spirit means becoming conscious and mindful of the creator, always in every situation. It is called in the Quranic terminology Taqwa. This is a sum total of all Islamic values it being it comes from faith sincere action The Spirit is nurtured Islam teaches by the acts of worship devotion five daily prayers",
      "fasting in the month of Ramadan, pilgrimage to Mecca, charity or zakat are all social acts but their primary objective is to nurture the spirit. By worshipping God we come closer to God and God comes closer to us. The Quran says make sajda, come closer. Sajda is when we put our head on the ground",
      "head on the ground, prostration. Make sajdah come closer and God also says in another hadith, in a Hadith Qudsi, my servant comes to me by acts of devotion until I love him when I love Him I am his eyes by which he sees, his ear by which He hears, His hand by which is holds and His feet by which",
      "The Qur'an is the spirit of the Divine Command.",
      "and uplift the human spirit. The Prophet says, these hearts get rusted as the iron gets rusted. People ask how to polish our hearts? How to cleanse them? He said read the Quran more often and remember your life is not forever. Remember death. Deeds of charity increase and enhance spirituality. Charity even a smile is charity",
      "charity. You heard the beautiful story of Ismail and working and struggling for peace and justice, helping the poor, the needy, the oppressed. These are all acts of charity. They nurture and shine their spirit. So those who nurture their spirit, their lives become beautiful. They live in peace and tranquility. They become the people of love, care and compassion. They are stable",
      "They are stable in their character. They do not change when others change, they do not do good to others only when others do good them but they pay for the coffee also. Even, very beautiful story that I did that. They even do good those who show anger and animosity towards them. They are patient and steadfast. Their actions are not superficial.",
      "recognized not by their appearances, but by their behavior and character. The more we nurture our spirit the more we can come closer to each other crossing all the divisions and barriers of races, colors nationalities and even religions then we shall see the Spirit of God in each one of us and that is a big task and that's what we have to work on so thank you Dr. Iva for bringing this point",
      "for bringing this point and may God bless Dr. Hassan Hathood for raising this consciousness in us. May God bless him, thank you."

      "All right, inshallah we'll begin.",
      "all those are here and those are online um we are continuing on our series on promise lost the story of benny israel uh session number eight",
      "session number eight. So last week, we went over a couple things in terms of the prophets and the Quran and the Bible what are similar and what are different. We talked about how the Romans came in after the Greeks and took over the Jerusalem area, and so forth our ruling over the people. And we've talked about their rule was a little bit different. Expanding the second temple there was a Herod was leader that was put on front",
      "leader for the Roman Empire. But he tried to please the people by expanding the Second Empire, we took up some pictures of that. We're talking about the killing of the prophets I claim that's mentioned in the Quran is that has any substance to it and we looked at a couple prophets are were killed if you guys remember who was with the candidates for the prophets are killed by there was Isaiah and then Zachariah and then Yahya right those are the three candidates that we did talk about.",
      "marima alayh salam uh born into the temple itself worshiping there yahya and then who is a son sakariya and we talked about briefly about the miracles of isaac so this was uh the last slide that we still we stopped on so it's really really quick just as a review he shall teach the book and the wisdom and the torah and the in jeel so",
      "day don't even acknowledge there's something called the injeel or the new testament uh they believe that's just much of you know bogus things that were written up by the christians and this shall be a messenger to the children i've come in which is i've comes with a sign from your lord that is i create for you from clay something like the shape of a bird i blow into it and becomes a live birds one of the miracles that he did i care for you the born blind give people back their eyesight leopards so it's kind",
      "some body disease that people had at that time and i caused the dead to come back to alive by the will of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala i inform you what you eat in your homes and what you store in your home and have come to you confirming the book which has sent down prior to me and that is the torah i make permissible some of what was prohibited to you and i've come to it a sign from your lord and so fear allah obey me allah surely your lord my lord and your lord so worship him and this is a straight path one thing about",
      "messiah or as a prophet uh but just as a jewish person that was misled that claimed to be the messiah as they believe that multiple people in history did that um and one thing is that one of their signs of the next messiah um uh is that he will not perform miracles so this is not something that you know he was the messias were supposed to do anyhow so this one thing argument that they'll have against jesus peace be upon we're going over",
      "they were thinking of the people. So how did Yisrael Islam, obviously with the babies in the last life so like he's coming up now he's growing up how did he preach to Ben Israel what are some things to say? So just understand a lot about what was going on in that society at that time. A lot of it is taken from the New Testament literature obviously that was kind of the book that was written at that there's also a historian called Josephus that wrote a lot also about the history of the Jews and the Christians.",
      "two main groups called the pharisees and sadducees right the pharaohs were like common people that believed in the oral translation of the of the torah it's nothing always written down but what people would practice okay and uh and then you have the sadduces or more about the written translation of",
      "or other things, if you will. A lot of it, their religion lacked a lot of spirituality which you can argue today is still the case and that's why Christians come on the very opposite end where they're only about love when you talk about them right? Jesus loves you, cared for you died for your sins, right? They don't really want to talk about logic wise that can a man be a god God can be a man It's more than you guys are very sinful You need to love God He died for his sins, so they're all in the other spectrum Islam is wasaltiyah, right in the middle So what did",
      "So what did Isa, peace be upon him, what did he say? So Allah SWT talks about multiple things in the Quran. There's about 93 ayat in the Qur'an that talk about Isa, okay? And when Jesus brought clear proofs, right? Some of these miracles that we mentioned, He said, I've come to you with wisdom and may clear to you some of that over which you differ. So fear Allah and obey me. And a fraction of the children of Israel believed and a fraction disbelieved.",
      "disbelieved so he supported those who supported those to believe against their enemy and they became dominant okay so Allah says yes he did have believers he didn't have a fraction of them in Arabic right uh which could be a small number it could be A little bit bigger than you know a little bit more than 20 30 40 people or so okay but that means it's just a small group nonetheless that's the word in Arabic so there's a group I believe another group that I didn't believe and we're going to go into a little",
      "issues did he have with the children of Israel okay when he came there what was he seeing okay so one thing that you talked about the Sabbath that they had very strict rules where they said you know what Sabbath is if you guys don't know what the Sabbath is um everybody say stuff is that is that you know you don't work on Saturdays you don' do any kind of effort on Saturday it's a day of rest and his day of just worship if you will okay and so they have really strict things that you can't even light a flame that is too much effort you can tie a knot",
      "can't tie a knot let's say i don't know if they had shoes or what at that time that would be too much if you will and what happened jesus basically mentioned in the new testament that he was curing people on the seven seven and so they they you know they they admonished him for doing that now what are you doing work on the sabbath floor this is not what you're supposed to be doing because basically i'm helping somebody well don't you want to help people right it's not like",
      "That's all they cared about. They didn't care about the spirituality behind it. And us as Muslims, we have aspects of this where people say, brother, you're supposed to stand like this and your arms are supposed to be like this in Salah. And they forget about how you're focused on your prayer. We have these aspects of that even in our religion. Focus on the external righteousness. So your beard, your pant length, right? Forget about what's in your heart if you care for the Ummah, you care",
      "say salam to them, right? Is this how long you're buried is? How long is this and so forth. So they have that same thing also in Jesus' case when I'm dealing like that. Corrupt leaders, Pharisees on the Sadducee we mentioned, that he argues with them, in front of them, tells them really bad names. You know, you guys are hypocrites. You guys are just fools that you just want to have the attention of the people. He'd like people to call you rabbi because it makes you feel good. When you come to gatherings, you want to sit in the front. He tells them all these type of different things",
      "type of different things um you guys don't practice what you preached right and you guys are just uh you know you're misleading the people isolate from ordinary people you don't want to talk to the adulteress you don' t want to speak to those with in the high class and that's why he says right here in the book of matthew you know we would just take out the grain of salt that woe to you teachers of the law and the pharisees you hypocrites you shut",
      "won't even interact with the normal people and jesus would do that he will go with the",
      "guess what? You're going to be public enemy number one. And no one's going to like you. But as a prophet, you can't just be quiet. Like the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. He had to talk about Abu Sufyan, Abu Jahl, Abu Lahab. You guys are worshiping false gods. Guess what? Public enemy number 1. It's part of a job of a prophet. People are not going to love you all the time but you got to say the truth. And that's what he did and that's obviously brought anger of the Jews upon him. So the response of Ben Israel to Isa A.S. What was his response?",
      "So a small portion of the people believed in him. Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la calls them the Hawariyun, the Hawarijin. Some say in the Tafsir books that there were 12 and that is the Christian belief that there was 12 and Jesus being the 13th. The 13th number is also a very superstitious number in history so who knows if that was exactly right or later on it was brought into the books from other pagan beliefs. Some said it was 27 as mentioned some of the Tufsir Books. Nonetheless numbers are super important",
      "Why were they called hawariyun in the Quran? Some say that the word hawari comes from the word to be like white, having a white garment very bright because that's what his followers would wear. And some say it comes from a term to be as helpers and supporters. That's what they call it. So Allah SWT uses the terms hawariyun. In English they call them disciples. You can use any term you like too. So when Isa A.S. sensed",
      "sense, he had a feeling of disbelief among the children of Bani Israel. He said to them who are my helpers in the way of Allah? Who will help me against what's going on in society? Who will hold me on and preach? The disciples say we are the helpers of Allah. And we believe in Allah so be our witness that we are Muslims, we are submitters in you. Our Lord we have believed in what You have revealed",
      "So record us amongst those who bear witness.",
      "And because they were lit upon the, some say on the poor side of our society or less fortunate side of the society economic wise. They wanted food. They want it to eat okay and also they wanted to see a miracle from Isa that would kind of increase their Iman So they have this summa surah Ma'ida is named after Ma'idah means like a table spread of food in Arabic",
      "the name you call a table that has food up on it if it doesn't have food on its not a maida so they have this incident right here sort of my idea where they ask is when the disciples said yeah he's son of mary marian can your lord send down on us a table of food from the sky he said fear allah if you are believers why are you asking me this for you're supposed to believe in allah subhanahu wa ta'ala you shouldn't just you know you shouldn t want anything else something similar to that",
      "to that you remember the story what did musa alayhi salam do something similar where he wanted to see something right remember we went on the mountain yeah a lot can i see you and what happened is all this look at that mouse right there you'll see me what happened the mountain exploded and then he fell down",
      "and then he fell down himself, right? So even though the Prophet wanted to increase Ibrahim alayhis salaam. So yeah Allah you know, Arni kifatuhin mawta O Allah show me how You bring back people back to life. Don't you believe Ibrahim? I just want my heart to be at content. I wanna see it. So then Allah told Ibrahim Alayhi Salaam anyone know this story? Take four birds",
      "take four birds, right? Cut them up in pieces. Put it on four different corners of the mountains, call them to you and the birds came back together. If you were there that would be enough for you to believe in but only means that Ibrahim was the only one there that saw that. Same thing they're asking for a sign so Allah sends down this sign for them They said,",
      "because everyone else is kind of saying like he's not a prophet. He's this, he's that and he's a madman etc. So you want to see a little bit of the sign and you may become witnesses to it. So Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala sends down this ma'idah. Whether this correlates to some of you might know the history of Christianity there's a thing called the Last Supper where they have a big table spread and they have the disciples are there Isa l-Islam is in the middle he's eating which is what's called the last supper or the last dinner it's because he gets caught right after that I think",
      "after that and crucified at least the christian narrative would be if you will so if it's the same one then we could take it if it was not in this list at another time yes yeah yeah so after their eat the romans came in with the jews um to uh to capture him",
      "was when to go wash his hands like after the food and I'll wash himself. And then they capture him after that, which is interesting because the Hadith of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam will go over when we get to the signs of the end of the world, that Isa Alayhi Salam will come down on two angels in Damascus on the white minaret with water dripping from his head. Right? Which is like what's the water dripping? What does that even mean? So if he was taken in that state without water, then you would return right... It's kind of like the shuhada",
      "right it's kind of like a parallel bill the way they died and resurrect them the same way the wounds will still be there that people know that these people were shuhada they died it's kinda an honor i mean it was kind of gruesome blood and so forth but it's on the day judgment a little bit different but uh you as he would have water dripping like pearls dropping from his head allah if you put all the stories together pieces if he was taken right after you made that water",
      "there i could i could probably possibly be it um because he's coming back to die a proper death and he has sweat oh interesting believer okay that maybe that's what it seems like i just put those together i didn't know about the hadith",
      "interesting interesting yeah maybe that could be also a problem right so they get this table spread right right um what else did allah mentioned about an israel",
      "came to them with clear signs and the disbelievers among them said this is nothing but clear magic right he's a sorcerer same thing they said about the prophet allah right that all this stuff that you're doing is his magic he's the sorcerer he's like possessed you know it's not it's an american thought so what we see this with the prophet it's the same story if you will those who just believed amongst the children of israel were cursed for the tongue of daoud alayhissalam",
      "obeyed and used to exceed the limits so a lot of saying that going back to the old islam we skipped this part when he went over his life that lost father's saying that daul islam and eastland curse the children of israel they were cursed multiple times already they have like a big list of cursing if you will it sounds like you know probably didn't need any more but you know it's you know have another prophet uh curse them um you know this kind of shows",
      "but nonetheless a loss author confirms that and so can i eat out there okay to really understand the ben israel's plot against jesus peace upon wanting to kill him we went over a little bit already that he's making fools of their religious leaders the sadducees and the pharisees right uh he's starting to get a follow following people are seeing his miracles people are starting to understand what he's saying is that it's kind of true",
      "temple of sulim al-islam supposedly right the building back of it if you will the second temple um they're they're trading their gambling they're betting in it they're doing a bunch of other things in it and some people are picking up that you know he's saying something right getting a follow so the jews obviously don't like that very much and they want to kind of shut that down in 26 cd common era so i'm finally done with this bc type thing now we're back in the common era the non-jewish roman uh roman governor",
      "governor Pontius Pilate okay it's a good name to know because he's very famous in history here that he is put as the governor of Jerusalem of Judah okay they call that area Judah okay and to rule over it by the Roman Caesar at the time called um Tiberius right here is let me come up put him over as their leader okay so Ponder pilot is a not he's on a Jew before if you guys don't remember Herod",
      "was put in there. But now they're putting a non-Jew there. It's a little bit different than what happened in the past. So he's not like a puppet Jewish leader. He's a non Jew Roman leader that's there and the Jews obviously don't like him at all. Number one, he is not Jewish. And why are you ruling this land with a temple there? This is a holy place. And so he does a lot of things to kind of aggregate the Jews. He starts taking the pictures of the emperor Tiberius and putting it in the temple and putting around the city",
      "around the city and people don't want that because it's almost like a paganism type thing even though they're doing a bunch of other wrong things but this gets them for some reason okay amongst other things that they don't like what he's doing so there's a tension between him and the jewish people okay and so i mentioned in the book of john here we're going to the testament here a little bit as historical facts then pilot conscious pilot",
      "and they start complaining about Jesus, peace be upon him. They want them to do something because they're not ruling so they wanted some type of laws against them. So they said to Pontius Pilate take him yourself or Pontius tells the Jews sorry take him to yourself and give him a trial by your law he's a Jewish person why are you guys coming to me for? The Jews said to him it is against our law to put anyone to death which I don't think that's possible it's true but they bring it up",
      "bring it up they want that well they want the blood on whose hands right they went on the Romans hands okay uh then probably went back into the courtroom and he called Jesus and said to him are you the king of the Jews this was an accusation against just peace be honored okay it wasn't that you're a false prophet or you're not the Messiah they wanted to make it what political why because I will get to what the romance I'll get their attention that this is the uprising that's",
      "Uprising that's happening. There's a king here that wants to take back governance of this area He's called the King of the Jews so watch out for that, right? So I guess possible It's you know his attention Right. So he can actually are you calling yourself the king of the dudes? He said are there the ones I call me that it doesn't mention the Bible He does say that I am the king and the juice meaning as a prophet of the jews if you will okay So that's what is mean acquisition like accusation against him is that he is claiming",
      "he is claiming to do that's what the jews say and then the loves right so they you know they don't want an uprising but you see pasha's pilot as you see right here he doesn't really want to harm them this is a story behind it like his wife has a dream that jesus is actually a good man and he goes up to pontius pilate and says you know let him go why are you harming this righteous guy for man for he said i don't wanna do anything but they keep on pushing me right because he's a roaming he doesn' t really care about jewish traditions he like he doesn''t really care if he's calling himself",
      "doesn't really bother him at all but at least the political term as king is what he's kind of looking at go to the book of matthew once again new testament stuff here pilots saw that he could do nothing and the people were making loud calls and there was much pushing around so they're coming in there they're really telling you know kill jesus no crucify him which was a roman type of punishment so he took water and washed his hands in front of the people let's watch this pilot wash his",
      "of the blood of this good man because he like i said couldn't find anything wrong with him did he steal no did he kill someone no you just claim to be the king of the jews like i don't really follow them too much i could see that could be a political problem so he says andy you know i don' t i'm not i'm guilty of the blod of this gdman if we try to kill him i'm innocent then look what the jewish say this you know according to the new testament of course the jewsh don't believe in the new testament is they said this is of your own doing then the people benny israel says",
      "says let his blood be on us and our children so they're saying no problem we'll take it we'll that responsibility let it be upon us on our children essentially it's interesting today because if you look up some things the modern day of how the jews explain the death of jesus they said oh all the romans it's the romANS they didn't like him we're not responsible for that right they try to push that on the romAns and Pontius Pilate and make him look bad obviously",
      "They need their money, actually. Because they need to build something, right? And so these people are allies. So they don't want to do that. It's always good to have a Christian and Jew in front of you asking about what's your position on Jesus? Right? And it's an interesting dialogue to see the truth come out. So that they can at least wake up and understand what they're saying and what they believe in. But they said out there, they were kind of proud. Let his blood be on us and our children. We have no problem. You know, we killed prophets before, other people before. This is like an ordinary thing. Kind of prideful and boastful",
      "and boastful, and arrogant to say something like that. Right? And then Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la mentions on Ali Imran where he kind of goes over exactly the death or at least the attempt to kill Isa Alayhi Salaam So the opponents of Isa Alaysalam, the Jews you can say the Romans with them okay devise a plan Okay? And Allah devised a plan and Allah is the best of planners When Allah said Oh Isa I'm going to take you in full",
      "and raise it towards myself, and cleanse you from those who disbelieve. And to place those who believe, those who follow you above those who don't believe up to the day of judgment. Then to me is your return. That's clear. It's coming back. Okay? Then you will return whereupon I will judge between you and that over which they have differed about. Obviously Allah SWT is talking about is he God or he's not God? Is he a prophet?",
      "God? Is he a prophet? Is He madman? What was He? Okay. So Allah says that I'm going to take you up. I'm gonna take you and raise you up towards Me. There's a lot about this ayat itself, a lot of opinions on what exactly happened to Isa. Did Allah cause him to die and then brought him up? Was he alive? Did Allah call him like a sleeping person and just fell asleep and then",
      "we know isaac is on the anyone remember from israel you get two thousand points if you get this answer right this is a hard one yeah okay let's start like three or four i no not the first one not the",
      "um so remember i want to once very clear because this is a problem with our translation with the story and anytime you see the word samawat in the quran i've seen multiple times some of you guys know this that uh they translate as heavens which is a very christian term like the seven heavens right we don't believe jannah has seven layers there's a hadith that says jannah",
      "realms that are above us so islam was on the third not in jannah he's not enjoying it yet hey judgment technically we're in time we're at a time right now hasn't started yet okay time isn't made of thing anyhow but anyhow right so but he's in this third level of the sky he's lying in general maybe that's where he wait he was waiting to come back down okay that's just the level right now that's all we really know right so allah has taken him up replaced them there and",
      "and then he'll come back down we'll talk a little bit later what's going to happen when he comes back up but i lost it that you were um then to me is your return so it's gonna be uh you know uh uh return of him now look al-assan says this i'm gonna take you i'm taking the fall and raise you up for myself and clean give those who disbelieve now when did that happen did it happen right after the last supper the maida when he was put on the cross that allah taken from there and put someone else right there is multiple opinions of what actually happened here at this point here",
      "this point here some said that that allah put one of the disciples remember those are his believers that volunteer that i will sacrifice for you isa right we believe in you let and allah puts isa's body form on him so when the romans came in they said ah that's him but allah already took up isa alayhi salam a long time ago and took that man and then put him on the cross and then crucified",
      "what's written in the new testament there's a one of his disciples called judas iscariot judas was a hypocrite that actually works with the romans and he takes money to tell them where is jesus right now so you could find him in this house and you could kill him okay as mentioned after they take jesus and they put him on the cross this is all christian belief here that judas feels bad",
      "where at the end he dies anyhow so was that him on the cross as a punishment allah put on him or not okay you would think that somebody who's on that cross there will be documented in christian literature that i'm not jesus i just look like you're saying something that would be documented right maybe something he would say something like that but all you have is mentioned the bible that he's on the and he says that god why have you forsaken me",
      "that or something else if you will right interesting very detailed actually in the Bible it's like hours like an hour by hour account I mean yes exactly when they celebrate now all these events yeah specific hours right yeah they go like 8 p.m and then oh yeah",
      "and then he walked with the cross, he stopped in 14 places. And they have these 14 places mapped out or 12 to 12 okay 12 and then after when he died that they opened the tomb and he wasn't there which will fit our narration that you know it wasn't him in first place but whose body was it that was crucified? Allah says that it is looked like that was him on the cross which I believe I have the ayah here yeah here it is this is skip to this one here right so",
      "And so when he sat, Allah said, go ahead. Well from being a baby they talked in the cradle. So you can say that he became a prophet at that moment and then supposedly he died at 33 CE so 33 years old. Then sometimes, that's one of the hadith mentions that when he comes back to earth he will live seven years so you get like around 40 which is like the age of Shukda",
      "say that i'm just like um maturity if you will and he'll die at that age so anyway when people come from but he's already a prophet so uh people kind of just put these two numbers together yeah not die she probably meant that what when did he was he raised right",
      "right yeah but wait the second thing was uh also like the funny thing is it talks about the bible that says he was crucified but then it does it also says that i'm sure you read this version since what hurts crucified his curse it says that oh he does say that yeah that's true very true so this is the ayah here where allah says for their saying talking about the jews for they're saying indeed we have killed the messiah okay they're just mocking saying",
      "jesus the son of mary messenger of allah they don't believe he's a messanger in law so they said that purposely to mock them they lost it they did not kill him nor did they crucify him so by that term right there we know that i wasn't lost that was an islam on the cross at all he never made it up there the law says that you didn't crucify himself so he never paid attention to being in that position of crucification um but another was made to resemble okay",
      "Iscariot looked like him. This is his disciple, right? So that's also why some of the Tafsir authors went with that opinion, that it was Judas. But anyhow, like I said, a lot of these leaders made someone resemble them and we'll just take it from there. It's kind of interesting to look at the opinions nonetheless. And indeed those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They're definitely in doubt exactly who that was, what happened even the Christian literature I mentioned they opened the tomb, nobody was there they have a bunch of other stories after that",
      "stories after that um and they have no knowledge except following their own assumptions which is a great explanation of exactly what they're doing they did not kill him for certain says they did so i mentioned the opinions here was a disciple that made to look like him or it was judas iscariot or allah exactly what happened okay wanted to go back to this here",
      "here. So if he was not the Messiah in the eyes of the Jews, who is the Messiah? And why did they reject him for it? So they have multiple conditions that they believe that's in the Torah with the Tanakh that is what is a description of the Messiah when that person would come. So one is that you'll be a great political leader from the descent descendants of King David, Dawood alayhi salam. Okay. Was Isa alayhis salaam from that lineage",
      "lineage allahu alam i would assume he wouldn't be because judah was the only tribe that was there um but he wasn't a political leader right he didn't really want to do anything with politics he was working on people's hearts and not let him do like fighting in you know selling in the church and so forth for the temple if you will uh he will restore that jewish nation so for them x like no or i could say cross that out he didn' t do that at all okay he didn''t overflow roman rule so if he's gonna be a political power then he should try to get liberation",
      "get liberation of that land from the Roman Empire, which he didn't do. So they don't believe that he was a good candidate for that. He will be born naturally from a husband and wife. So this miracle birth doesn't really follow their signs. He would not be divine in nature. You could say that came much later on in Christianity, that he wasn't divine. So at this moment, that's not really a good argument for the Jews to say that he isn't divine in",
      "at that time i think it comes on later on with the council of nicaea he will not um you will not come to bear any sins of humanity so one of those roles have to come i'm going to die for your sins okay so that doesn't follow what they have in there that sounds like something else someone else changed that which all people believe the christians believe when would they put that in their books jews will follow the torah and practice it at his time they believe all the jews who follow the torrent and practice",
      "i don't think they'll ever get this one done um you know present day in the future that and the jews are very secular especially the uh israelis for sure so for them to fulfill that he could build a temple whatever you're not going to get this checked off you know what i mean long shot i'm trying to see that they're really going to follow the the torah and practice it okay he will usher in an age of justice and peace we do believe when the dijal comes he's gonna go through all",
      "okay because of his power and so forth we don't believe that's justice in peace in their eyes they might believe it because they're you know they follow those type of things all the people recognize the god of the jews i feel that's a long shot too but he does believe that that we believe that this gel when he comes to perform miracles bring people back from dead to life and p and he will say that he'll start off that i'm a prophet and then he'll sort put his narration that i am actually god himself",
      "follow what we have in our books at least in the hadith if you will he would gather jews and excel and bring them all together so this is one they believe jesus didn't do because people were still in exile at his time and he didn't put any effort to get him from different different areas of land those that were still",
      "the messiah will gather everyone back into the land right now i think that's a long shot also if it hadn't happened today they're not going to leave their land they're quite wealthy wherever they are and another one is that people rebuild the temple this is a big one here okay so that's what i was talking about the dome of the rock in the area that is one thing that he would do is rebuild that temple when jesus peter was there what happened the temple was",
      "it was already built up remember herod you know built it up we took pictures of it last week we looked at those pictures so it was arty there so therefore he cannot be the messiah because it has to be destroyed and then built back again which is where we're in the current phase right now so that's why they would say that he didn't fulfill any of these type of things some of them say that even if you feel one so therefore, he's a false messiah and he was misled and much other things than what they'll say about him okay so that how they would deny him",
      "this is from torah and their books and other things um that they mentioned a good amount of videos exactly even orthodox jews non-zionist jews will say that we're not supposed to be in that land we were waiting for the mashiach the messiah",
      "trying to force issue let's gather first and let him come that's out of order a little bit but he I mean there was going to be some people there but he said when he comes get them to come if you will so they say that you know we should be waiting we should we're in exile right now at least so the non-zionist Jews will believe that also the number two right it's right there I think it's an abomination to have a modern state of Israel a non-religious state of history yeah by non-practicing Jews yes",
      "yeah they're not very practiced so like i said they have to practice the torah and go over all those laws and so forth and so which i don't think that you know that's very hard to get any community to practice everything so like I said another thing and I didn't even go into going back to these things and this in the book of Ezekiel and going back",
      "even looking are that even authentic where those statements came from that's a whole nother angle we could look at who wrote that in that book when was that written right who wrote it with their hands that's another thing we can look into but that's something they believe right now and the author on the authorization of those type of things right so it's a different angle to look at um so what happened after israel there's a lot to say each point i have on these slides",
      "My point of this class to get really surface understanding of it then you know we have at least an understanding what happened Everyone could kind of look into it later on so after the death or they will say the death of Israel Islam will say that these a limb was Raised raised up. The Jews were persecuted persecute the followers of Christ Okay, so whoever was a disciple Are your mark? Because we saw you following him right so they offer his supposedly death",
      "wherever they were in the land. They wanted to kill them, but they didn't like them at all. The disciples and followers had to hide and flee in Jerusalem and go deep inside the Roman Empire to be away from the Jews that were in Jerusalem at that time. Some went to Rome to preach. They were murdered when they were found. Big part here, in 36 CE Pontius Pilate dies. And the Roman empire after that goes back",
      "and puts one of the descendants of herod remember herod maybe it was a jewish person puppet jewish leader put the one descended from him to self-govern now jerusalem okay so that's a big change right because wasn't uh jewish now there's a jews quote unquote leader down that's governing the lands of jerusalem there we're going to see what that's going to do in a bit okay jews and the christians class",
      "Some of his followers would go into the temple and start to preach to the Jews that you are misled, right? How dare you kill, you know, the Christ, you now, the Messiah. And then they will be persecuted, et cetera. In 66 CE, the Jews finally decided we're going to revolt against the Romans, right because now they have a somewhat of a Roman king or someone of a Jewish King. And so this side, you were sick of this Roman rule over us. We're gonna revolt against them.",
      "they start the revolt. The Roman Empire at that time, his name was Nero, he decided to send an army out to Jerusalem to fight against this rebellion. It took four years for them to finally conquer the city of Jerusalem. So 4 plus 66 you're going to get 70. In the year 70, that's when they destroy the second temple and now we'll pick up from next week that they destroy",
      "temple and now they don't not have a temple ever up to today it was never rebuilt again after that so they're in like a two 2 000 year plus drought of building back the temple you know which is a big sign for them whether you know what's supposed to happen or not right i will go a little bit how that temple was destroyed uh when armies happened um the jews actually put up a pretty good fight against the the romans but at the end",
      "We'll move in a little bit after that to the Islam and what happens, you know, after the Romans get to meet the Muslims and so forth after the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. So we'll stop here in terms of this. Stopped a little early actually. Of where we are right now in terms",
      "i don't know harold was alive i believe he was dead and this son came into power after that and his son's the one that had the lady dance in front of him remember then told me kill yahya yeah so i don' t know if his son was in power what i understand pontius pilate was a governor of judah over at that time",
      "uh also by that time 66 and 70 it was well before with the romans were still the qualities at that time oh 100 yeah took him much longer to do the venture they were one of the first christianity right yeah yeah that's in costas noble's um constantine's dream but that's like a 200 or 300 or so where he has a dream about christianiy then he makes an old empire embrace christiany we're going to talk about the council of nicaea and stuff after that",
      "right right yeah there's no clear thing i didn't really go over that because it's not really a venus or israel issue it's more of a christian issue and one of the class a little bit just on venue sorry but to answer your question there's",
      "That's a key word here. Everyone understands the word explicit means, right? Clear cut no ambiguity to the word that I am God. For example, say Allah is one. Right? I'm your Lord. There is nothing like that. There are implicit references that you could say what is that? Metaphorically he's saying I'm the son of God or I am",
      "or is he saying that i'm a prophet i'm guided by god the only way to god is through me now if the prophets said that we want to understand that follow the sunnah and then you'll get to you'll you'll see the christians will take that that he's a son of god and so therefore you have to go through him believe in him believe it as sacrifice so to answer your question there's only um you know not explicit but implicit um uh statements that are very vague and metaphorical",
      "vague and metaphoric in nature that the Christians will take and understand that, okay, this might mean that he is a son of God. Another term, the word son is used multiple times in the Bible to make religious people. We are sons of God means we are religious people so other people were called the son of god in the bible. He wasn't unique at all but we can go over some of them which is the last bible",
      "four bibles that the oldest one so the earliest ones don't really have any of those type of references you have luke matthew mark if you will but um we can go over that if you want to have a whole presentation on that okay",
      "i mean that's what i'm thinking about authorization father can be should have multiple original words yeah exactly necessarily is implied in this version yeah and it's been used because one of those references later on hundreds of years later or he said anything yeah that's one one there's all the prophets that um you know um",
      "Right, so they're like all there's three right there. They're all bearing testament in heavens. They are all the same but doesn't mean that he is God. Could be that how we believe the Prophet will pray a Testament that we got the message and did we follow it? He'll be a Shaheed against us, right? He would be a shaheed, he'd be a witness against us or for us So they take those type of statements and like all of see 3-1 1-3. So there's nothing that is you know Explicit in terms of understanding",
      "I would be interested in what is the point of view about the first generations of Christians. Before they were the Trinity and the Son of God, are they considered fully righteous followers of Allah? Like the first probably maybe becoming six seven eight generations.",
      "is a group that christians um that were that believed in jesus as a prophet you know we have the very famous story of samanatharasi um that was a because he's zoroastrian madusi and then later on he followed these advices and finally meant real true christians and what we want to understand followers of jesus peace be upon him as a profit but they're very small numbers i forgot the group actually what's what they're called historically",
      "i forgot the name yeah it's on tip of my tongue forgetting them but they are the ones that believe that jesus and there seem certain modern groups that believe jesus is a prophet oh you have to see me during your time came out historians nestorians amazing um",
      "oh we skipped all but during his life so if you have um when exactly what year uh i it doesn't really mention the crime but somewhere between 0 and 33. so sometime there that he did get that scripture and that was a new law that they would follow um but like i said most of stuff in the gospels are more just telling them warning the benny israel if you read this four main gospel that they believe that",
      "won't call the angel because we believe that's not authentically percent you know preserved but you have you know matthew mark and luke and they have last one called john i believe these three right here if you ever study them and i'm not saying about this you know mcconover lecture series about these things you'll see that jesus keeps all talking about the day of judgment starting that he's coming here to warn them the world ending you know turn your maker and then replant etc it's only the book of john that kind of has some description",
      "a part of God or some type of divinity, if you will. But it looks like all he really was coming to him, the end worlds are coming, you guys need to repent, you know, you need to change, don't do this, don' t do that. But you'll see all that's really more talking about what he's talking about if you ever read through them and a lot of them are copied almost like copy and paste from each other which is another thing that Bible scholars were arguing that there was some other documents that someone copied and pasted called the Q document that copying and pasting all these books too but one year as I mentioned before Ann",
      "of quran i don't know when if christian uh you know historians or scholars have a year without when he got them the gospels if you will because they were all written later on it wasn't like me he got it and he had it in his hand these are books matthew mark john and luke that was yeah well not necessarily like 60 77 book of john is like 90. so that you're talking about 60 years after he died at this point",
      "this book came up in the year 90. And also, if you look at any of the Bibles, I did a lecture set for a youth group about a month ago. If you have a Bible here today, if your look on the Book of Mark and Matthew, John, you'll see it says according to Matthew, according to Luke, according",
      "guys, what do you say? I'm like, I don't know. You will throw tomatoes and eggs at me or something like that, right? Like, what are you doing again? What kind of religious advice have you given us? I don' t know about this hadith but just write it on WhatsApp. I don''t know, right. But this is their gospel according to this and they don't who the author is. If you argue with them, they'll say that it was inspired by God from these individuals. I'm so beautiful. I mean, I'm inspired by god too, right, tell me how do you know? And so that's a really big thing",
      "a really big thing for them right if it was hadith literature this will be in like the weak hadith you know realm if not fabricated fabricated well you know name to the sahih you know yeah that's funny because even if like like for argument's sake like even if there wasn't explicit verse saying god is like number one it's like yeah likely just said these are anonymous authors how can we trust them and so it's also like yeah it's",
      "there's three different johns they don't even agree upon who john was it's like yeah there's",
      "i can't find it right now but anyhow um but yeah so there's a lot to say and i didn't really want to go down that path that's more about christianity in our class what you could argue from christians are jews um really when it comes down to it um because you know they're labeling themselves as christians but you know their really you know jews but the thing is though that they opened it up to anyone that could become a christian and that's when they lost the lineage",
      "ethnicity so they really close the door on that you know I mean so but anyway there is yeah yes there is tons of them I think 170 or 40 or something like this if you will",
      "i don't know if we still have there yeah it's like yeah these are all like different from each other right right right yeah i think actually do you have this let me see if i can put this up here but we're going like on a we're gonna our big tangent now might as well do it in like a couple minutes we have some time here right um what is old and new just so new is from jesus peace upon afterwards old is before him",
      "is before him okay and and old i believe uh it's 66 books or 27 books um that and the the books of muslim is only the first five of them and there's a bunch of other books that that came out that was written afterwards okay so we that's one of the lectures we're going to have and i'm supposed to present this last couple weeks and i have not um we're gonna go over that what is actually um what is activity people use",
      "because the Jews don't believe nothing is old and new. They believe there's nothing called new in the first place, right? I just want to go over the sons of God using the Bible. Now, this is from a book of Job that says, now there was a day when the sons",
      "which was a son of god so the son of adam was the son but here once again the son",
      "to jesus peace palm as meaning a father-son type of relationship you know um yeah there you go hebrew accounts 24 books there you um torres the five books maybe i'll go over this one of these days uh you know what i did there but uh i have a full presentation that go overall like the bible and also the christian's belief in jesus and multiple places in the in the bible where he says that don't call me good only the father is good so he's clearly saying that i'm not god",
      "God right so you have a lot of clear statements you know why are you calling me good for only the father is there only the Lord is good right so he's making a clear distinction that there's something the Father and me are different they ask him when the day of judgment is going to happen he's all the only one knows the agenda is a father but the son does not know so it's very clear like showing that what he doesn't know only God knows if you're a Christian you will read those passages I would assume you scratch your head and say like hey",
      "you know why if he's a son of god he would know when the day judgment happened you know he wouldn't call himself not good you know but there's like i said we're down this road right now with um christians that's all another thing um anyhow uh we're i have something one more last thing oh yeah just wanted to add on to this even like i've heard um if you know any christians like i don't somebody who actually is christian like sometimes you'll hear them say like oh we are the children of god like this humanity so it's like well",
      "was singular and he can be the son of god now it's like oh we're all the children of god and i was like yeah there's a lot of contradictions there but inshallah next week we'll see if i got to present a little bit more on the books of the old testament new testament and then go a little what happens after the destruction of the temple in the year 70 and then we'll move on from there the roman empire stays there for quite a long time and then um and then",
      "this series in the next couple of weeks.",
      "we ask you to enter us in your Jannah, Ya Kareem, Ya Rabbil Alameen. Wallah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, we ask You to free the lands of Palestine and Lebanon all the Muslim lands that are being corrupted from foreign enemies destroy their enemies, Ya kareem ya rabbil alameen protect our brothers and sisters from war, fighting, killing, harm, Ya Rahman ya raheem.

      "In the name of Allah, the most merciful, the compassionate. Insha'Allah we'll be studying some ayat from section number 20 and starting ayah number 164 of Surah Al-Baqarah.",
      "والأرض واختلاف الليل والنهار والفلك التي تجري في البحر بما ينفع الناس",
      "in the name of allah the most merciful the compassionate behold in the creation of the heavens and the earth in the variations of the night and the day in the ships sailing through the ocean with what benefits mankind",
      "in that which sent down with allah sent down from the skies and he revised by it the earth after his death in the moving creatures of all kind that he create that is scattered through through it in the movement of the winds and the clouds subdued between the sky and the earth are surely signs for a people who understand",
      "The previous ayah, the ayah number 163 Allah says And your God is one God. There is no God but He most gracious, most merciful.",
      "So this emphasizes Tauhid, the basis of faith and the teachings of all the Prophets of Allah that there is only one God. Your God is One God. That means all humanity, all people your God is one God, Ilahul Waheed.",
      "is unique in his attributes there is no God except he so only God Allah is the god and there is No other God except Allah. Allah is unique, Allah is transcendent but sometimes people when they believe in the transcendence of God that God is unique",
      "is far away and he has no connection with the creation. Islam says that no God is one god, there is no god except Allah but at the same time He's Rahman and Rahim, He's compassionate and kind, He cares for His creation and He is involved in the affairs of His creation so He is most merciful",
      "there is transcendent God, God is beyond the creation does not mean that God is at a distance from the creation or God doesn't care for his creation. Some people used to believe, there were some Mushrikeen they used to belief that there is only one God but he created the world and then after that he went away so that's not the concept in Islam. God is One",
      "God is one, unique One, transcendent One but at the same time He is kind, caring, compassionate and He cares for His creation. When the Prophet presented this message to the Arabs of that time in Mecca and in Medina they said how do we know that?",
      "Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la mentions in this following ayah the many things that they knew that created by God actually Arabs used to believe that it is the heaven and earth are created by Allah and many things in the universe are created with Allah. The Quran has mentioned in seven different places",
      "But at the same time, they used to do shirk. Allah is pointing that look at phenomena of the universe. Look at the thing that God has created. The creations of this heavens and earth, the variation, the alternation of the night",
      "that move in the oceans, by which it brings benefit to the human being. The rain that comes down from above and by which the earth is revived and all kinds of creatures scattered on the land. The movement of the winds and the clouds,",
      "pointing that there is only one creator and there's only one god. And this creation is beautiful, this creation beneficial, and this creation has interconnected so everything is connected with the other and there is one who has control over everything",
      "And this requires using your aql, your mind, your reason. So those who understand, those who use their mind, their reason they can recognize that. If you pay attention to all these phenomena you will come to the conclusion that there must be one God Who has created all of that. Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala has mentioned here eight things",
      "And this is not the first time. The Quran has a number of times pointed out these things. Creation of heaven and earth, variation of night and day, ships sailing in the ocean for the benefit of mankind, rain coming down from the sky, reviving the Earth after its death, all kinds",
      "creatures scattered through the earth, movement of the wind, clouds between the sky and earth. These are the eight things that are mentioned here. The Quran emphasizes about heaven and earth Allah says He created the seven heavens above you",
      "you one over the other layer after layers and the lowest heaven has beautiful lamps stars sun and moon all of these things are these are part of the heaven that Allah created Allah has beautified it",
      "you see, بِغَرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا You do not see any pillars that are holding it. So this canopy that is above you, this canopy has no pillars. Nothing that is holding it Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la is the one who made that. The Quran talks a lot about the heavens, the creation of the heaven. Think about that. This vast heaven. Who created all that?",
      "And then the Quran mentions about the earth.",
      "Allah put mountains, Allah put rivers throughout the earth and ways by which you can walk and move and travel from one place to another. And this earth is stretched out, spread out like a carpet",
      "And so you can rest there on this earth. So Allah is pointing to the vastness of the earth, to the comfort that Allah has given to the people on this Earth so that people can travel, people can move, people take rest and also provision that comes out from the earth. All of these are signs of Allah. Quran is bringing out all of this point about the heaven and the earth",
      "And then Quran mentions about the variation of the night and day. And this is, And also it is mentioned, So there is Iqtilaf and there is Khilfa. Iqtalaf means variation, alternation.",
      "and khilfa is succession, that one comes after another. So yes the nights sometimes are long and sometimes days are long so they are winter nights and there are summer nights and this variation in the length of the nights and the day but it does not have hazard",
      "by which you can calculate your time. But at the same time, they are coming khilfa, succession one after another. The sun cannot take over the moon and the moon cannot take",
      "before can overtake the day. It does not happen that you get up in the morning expecting it's going to be day but it's night another day, another night no night goes the day comes the day goes the night come He covers the night by the day and they cover the day by the night",
      "And why this night? He made the night for you to take rest. To cover your view. So, the darkness of the night so that everybody can take rest it becomes calm and quiet. And the day comes and you can see the liveliness. The birds start singing and flying and people are moving and getting up",
      "And so the day becomes a day of business, the day for work. So all this is coming in succession one after another. Who's doing all that? How it is happening? Is it happening by itself or there is someone behind that who has made all of that?",
      "the variation of the night and the day. And then Allah SWT says, وَالْفُلْكَ الَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي الْبَحْرُ بِمَا يَنْفَعُ النَّاسِ And the ships sailing in the ocean. And the Qur'an has mentioned about the ships also many times. أَلَمْ تَرَىٰ أَنَّ الْفِلْقَ تَدْرِّي ف۪ي البرِّ بِنِعْمَةِ اللّهِ لِيَذِيهَكُم مِّن آيَاتِ Of course, fulks, the ships are made by human beings.",
      "move in the ocean is the blessing of Allah. How it can happen that these heavy ships, the weight is tons and tons of pound and kilo whatever of these ships and then you have they are moving on the water and water is very light but the water can hold them",
      "can travel on the water. The ships are moving on the ocean by the blessings of Allah, Allah has made them that way. Allah has make the water in such a way that it can hold the ships and ships won't sink generally speaking so that is ni'mah that is the blessing of Allah.",
      "So you see the fulk, you see that the ships are sailing through the oceans. And people travel and they bring their goods from other side, from other places. The long journey they do that.",
      "them that he has made ships for them and also animals for them on which they ride. And Allah SWT mentioned that He will create more things on which They'll ride at the time of the revelation of the Quran there were ships and they were animals or people would walk but now we have many more means of travel so that's why Quran says",
      "you many other things that you do not know yet and Allah says and a sign for them that we created their progeny and we raised they carried them in a loaded ship and that is the reference to Nuh",
      "Allah is the One who made this.",
      "can travel from place to place and benefit of humankind. This ships moving in the ocean what with that which will benefit humankind? And then Allah SWT mentions rain, and what Allah has sent down from above from the sky",
      "ni'mah from Allah and it's the blessing that the water comes from above pure clean water and that revives the earth. The earth is dead if there is no water, doubt comes and there is not vegetable to grow so Allah sent down this rain from the sky and rain itself is a sign of Allah,",
      "water comes from above and it comes in small drops if the whole full water come all at same time people will die. It will overhands them so a small drops come down and this is beautiful and this",
      "And we send down water from above that you drink. And the trees grow, the vegetables grow which you benefit from and your animals benefit from. So it is again a wonderful sign of Allah SWT if you think about it. Look at it. This phenomenon of rain. What a beautiful thing",
      "that the rain comes down from the sky and benefit the people, and revive the earth after its death. So look at the earth it looks like dead. And you see the Earth is all there dry nothing. And when the rain come after that you see",
      "and started growing vegetables come out from there. And beautiful plants come out, flowers come out all of these things. So dead earth becomes alive. Dead earth means dry earth it becomes alive the life comes into the earth and it gives great thing.",
      "all kind of creatures. Dabba is used in the Quran sometimes for beasts, so sometimes it's used dabba and tayr. So the beast that those that walk crawl on the earth and those who fly in the sky but sometimes the word dabbah is used for anything all the creatures that move",
      "there is no that being that moves on this earth except Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala provides for her, for that. Provides rizq, food, sustenance for everything. All kind of creatures scattered through the earth and all kinds of creatures are scattered all over",
      "and you see the movement of the winds what benefits are there in the winds Allah says the winds fertilize the plants, fertilize trees fruits come out by that so these winds pollinate take some pollination from one tree to another",
      "And we sent the winds so that by which the fruits come out. Allah is the one who sends the winds and the winds move the clouds",
      "and bring the clouds together, then they compile on each other. And after that you see the rain comes down. You see the Rain is coming down from those clouds. The winds are a benefit of Allah. Nobody can move the wind. Is there any power that can move wind other than Allah? These winds bring the cloud from different places",
      "places and wherever Allah wants these clouds bring the rain some areas still remain dry, the cloud move from one place to another so all kind of creatures and the winds clouds between the sky and the earth the clouds is beautiful clouds they're also a sign of Allah",
      "In this there are signs, ayat. Ayat are in the Quran that Allah revealed for the guidance of humanity and ayat are on the universe. Ayats for the universe, ayats for Al-Kitab, ayahs for Anfus. Signs of Allah in His book, in his message that He sent through His Prophet and especially the last prophet Muhammad",
      "salawatullahi wa sallam alayhi. Every verse of the Qur'an is called ayah, and ayaat in the universe. Everything is an ayah. And these ayaats are all over. In Surah Al-Rumah Allah says, All kind of ayaata of Allah.",
      "these ayats are pointing towards what? That there is a creator, that is the master creator. There is a wise creator and he created this universe beautiful everything that he created it is beautiful and then also beneficial everything brings benefit sometimes we may not realize it but everything has a benefit even the thing that we met that we may",
      "feel that they are harmful but they may have benefit only Allah knows sometimes we discover, sometimes we don't. But there is hikmah, there is wisdom in the creation of everything and all of these things are...the whole creation is interconnected it is not that one God is creating another thing, another god is creating",
      "The Mushrikin used to believe that. They used to think there is a God for rain, there is the God for sunshine, there's a God of earth, there are gods for heaven, there're gods for mountains, there god for this and that. So they have all kind of divided up this phenomenon, this creation. But Islam says no, there only one God who has created everything. And this is because the creation is interconnected. It's consistent.",
      "it is not that there is something happening in there and the other one doesn't know so if they are more than one god in this universe, there have been chaos. There has been corruption in the land. So this ayah is a beautiful ayah that emphasizes the variety of creation of Allah SWT and this creation is pointing to the creator",
      "to the Creator. In Surah Al-Imran you also have this, inna fi khalqa al-samawati wa ardi la'ayatil li ulil albaab Here it is mentioned, li qumi yaqiloon but there it is mention in the next surah that for people who use their minds and they are the ones who remember Allah Rabbana ma khalaqta hadha batila Lord You have not created all of these things for nothing useless",
      "useless. Do not make us among those who see all these things, benefit from all these",
      "not come out by themselves but they have come out because of there is a plan, there is the Creator, there's the wise creator and somebody is behind this phenomenon. So but still Allah says",
      "إذ جرؤنا العذاب أن القوة لله جميعا وأن الله شديد العذاق",
      "Among mankind there are some who take equals apart from Allah, loving them like loving Allah. But those who believe...",
      "who take equals apart from Allah, loving them like loving Allah. But those who believe are stronger in their love for Allah. If those who do wrong could only see when they see the punishment that the power totally belong to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment. When those who were followed disavow those who followed",
      "will see the punishment and all ties will be cut off from them. And those who followed will say, if we had another chance, we would disavow them as they have disavowed us. Thus shall Allah show them their deeds as a source of regret for them, and they shall not be getting out of that fire.\" So that is the...Allah is the one who created everything but there are some",
      "are some who go to others and they think that there are others beside Allah as gods among the people, they are those who make equals for Allah or apart from Allah. Andad are equals, Andad arrivals,",
      "who are beings other than Allah. So, need is the singular and that is plural. Allah has no need, Allah has not equal, there's no co-equal to Allah. There is no one who is God beside God. I mean there were people",
      "atheists but they were polytheists and they believed that there are gods beside God. So, they say yeah there is Allah but then they also believe in other gods some of them they would say they are minor gods he's supreme god but they're minor gods so Allah says there are some who make equals to Allah or partners to Allah Or some who share the divinity with Allah There are some",
      "some who do that and you had they love them just like people love Allah, they love Them like loving Allah I mean they are supposed to love Allah but instead of loving Allah They love those partners and they call claim that they were partners of Allah But there are no partners for Allah There is only one God so the believers they love Allah",
      "Allah and they do not associate anyone with Allah in their love as well as in their faith. So يُحِبُّونَهُمْ كُحَبِّ اللَّهِ is that love them like the love of Allah or believe in them, worship them. Worship is also love so faith is not just belief, faith is love, faith",
      "Faith is devotion. Faith is a close relationship between the human and the divine, and they are misdirecting their devotion to other beings instead of loving Allah they love others or they love beside Allah others",
      "faith, in terms of obedience that is exclusively for Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala.",
      "even more than their own self that is the sign of iman and you call allah who has said iman is this the person has a taste of faith he knows what his state what what is faith the one who loves Allah and His messenger more than anybody else",
      "Allah is because Allah is the Creator, Allah is Master, Allah Lord and Messenger because the messenger speaks on behalf of Allah. They don't worship the messenger but they love the messenger and obey the messenger, follow the messenger. Those who believe are very strong in their love for Allah",
      "And this love is the sign of Iman. And the more you have the love of Allah, the more You realize the presence of Allah. The more you realize who Allah and your relation becomes better and better. And this Love increases by devotion, by worship. This Love increases",
      "of Allah, Allah comes closer to them and they come closer to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala. The believers are very strong in their love for Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la They devote themselves to Allah and this love is beyond any other love. The Quran has mentioned that Allah is very loving so there are two types of love one is Allah's love for the creation for the people for the human beings",
      "for the human beings and other is human being's love for Allah. Allah loves human beings. And Allah says, you حبهم but يحبون The believers are those whom Allah loves and they love Allah so He loves them. Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la loves actually prior to their love",
      "and they belittle the love of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, and they turn to others. When they do that then the love for Allah goes away from them. Otherwise Allah's Love is there. So Allah is the one who loves unless the human being turns away from the love Allah.",
      "those who do wrong when they will see the azab then they will realize who has the power Allah is very powerful, Allah is mighty and He's also very loving. He was Rahman al-Rahim as we mentioned before merciful compassionate but when the day of judgment will come that people will see that all other beings they consider as God have no power",
      "And if Allah wants to punish, there is no one who can come to save. No one can take them away from that. So the people said we are going to save you they will not be able to save everybody will be concerned about themselves because on the day of judgment only Allah has all the power",
      "power. For whom is the kingdom today? The Kingdom belongs to Allah. When those who followed disavowed those who follow them, so those who were followed disallowed those who",
      "their followers abandon them, disavow them. They say we have nothing to do with you! On the day of judgment, people will come to their leaders and ask them help us, but they say we cannot do anything. Those who claim that they have divine power, those who claim",
      "You deceived the people and people were deceived by them. And they told them that we will save you, and they will not be able to save them. Those who are followed will disavow their followers. The Quran has mentioned this conversation",
      "between the leaders and followers, the false leaders. And their followers were fooled by them not the good leaders. Good leaders of course will be there because good readers always pointed to Allah and they always said follow Allah and obey Allah and His Messenger but the false leader said follow us listen to us and we'll save you so on that day even shaitan",
      "who misled many people, even Shaytan say, I disavow you. I have nothing to do with you. So tabarra allatheena ttubi'u minallatheeena ttawabu. Tabara is disawable, abandonment, living in the lurch, not helping.",
      "So the leaders are going to abandon their followers. And then the followers will see the punishment is there and there is no help. All the ties are broken. On that day, no one can help. Only Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala.",
      "on that day brothers are not going to help parents are not willing to help spouses are not",
      "the ties are going to be broken. And these of course, these are the ties on those who disbelieve, who did not believe in Allah. And then, now there is the followers are going realize that these leaders were fake leaders, these leaders and false leaders, and they are not helping. So they will say",
      "if there is another chance we are going to give up these leaders and we are",
      "diva is going to abandon their followers so now the follower say we wish we have another occasion, another chance but there's no other chance. There is no coming back through this earth after that. The Quran has mentioned many times this thing that people are going to the wrongdoers are going",
      "And we are going to leave our leaders, false leaders. They have left us.",
      "as regrets, as a source of regret for them. And whatever they did under the instructions of their false leaders all of this have no meaning there is no benefit so it will become hasrah, it will be a regret, source of sorrow. So thus Allah will show them their deeds and the source of sadness and the",
      "and they are not going to go out of hell nobody can take them out from the hell when people deny Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala reject Allah then there is no help for them the leaders are not willing to help them the leader cannot do that they can really cannot help themselves how can they help them so it is very important that people choose the right leaders",
      "the leader they point towards worship of Allah, point to the way of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala. Don't say that is I am God, I will do that, I'll do that. Quran did that, shayateen do that but the good leaders always say worship God, do not worship me,",
      "can help you to turn to allah that is the right approach and that is a right way so that's how Islam emphasizes in this Allah is the one who created all this beautiful universe the whole creation is created by allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and everything is pointing that there is one creator powerful creator great creator loving creator merciful creator everything is point towards that",
      "So don't go to anyone except Allah. Turn to Allah, obey Allah, believe in Allah and love Allah. And your love must be stronger, very much love more than anybody else's love of Allah.",
      "is faith. Faith is love. It's not just belief in certain articles of faith, but it is also deep connection bond between Allah and the human being. And this love increases by the acts of devotion. Allah said my servant keeps on coming to me closer to me by acts of",
      "This love of Allah increases. It is a dynamic love and the love is mutual. Allah loves the believers, and the believers love Allah. So relationship of the human being with Allah is the relationship of love. And this love is better than any love.",
      "deeper than any love yes we love our parents, we love children, we know our brothers and sisters, we have other people but the love of Allah must be over and above everyone. And that is faith, that is Iman. And leaders, the leader that you should follow, that they should follow are honest leaders good leaders not fake leaders or false leaders",
      "the false leaders who give promises but then those promises have no meaning because then they will leave them. The leaders will leave their followers and not be able to help them. May Allah keep us on the right path and help us understand His message and turn to Him, be connected with Allah",
      "Allah and any questions that we can take if you have any question please answer thank you Dr Siddiqui I don't see any questions at this time so i will just use",

      "and give patience to their family members. Also, those who are not well, may Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la give them shifa. Allahumma shifan tashafi ila shafia illa anta shifaa la yuwadir ussatma. Allah gives them, heals them and removes their pain and their suffering.

      "the section number 21 of Surah Al-Baqarah and that is starting from the ayat 168. As you may remember in the previous section Allah told us about His signs in the world, and there are many signs eight of them were mentioned",
      "creation of the heaven and the earth, the variation of day and night, ships that sail in the oceans, rain that comes out from above and revives the Earth after its death. All kinds of creatures that move on the Earth, the blowing of the winds, clouds, all these things are Allah's blessings and favours. In everything there is a sign",
      "there is a sign to remind us that there is the Creator, there is Lord who is wise creator kind creator beneficent and merciful. And also all this creation is pointing out that there's only one who has controlling all this it is not divided into various leaders and Lords but it is one Lord",
      "one Lord, one Lord of all. But there are some people who make shirk so Quran is spoke about There are people who Make equal to Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala but the believers recognize that only Allah is the Lord and then mention that Some of those people who mislead The humanity",
      "the humanity on the day of judgment they will not come to their aid. They will all disavow them and disown them, and say we cannot help you. And followers will then recognize that how deceitful those leaders were who misled them,",
      "and disavow them as they have disavowed us today. And this is the regret that will happen. So Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala after this mentions that Allah has created beautiful things on this earth, enjoy them and follow the rules of Allah. So let's begin with that with ayah number 168.",
      "يا أيها الناس كلوا مما في الأرض حلالا طيبا ولا تتبعوا فطوات الشيطان إنه لكم عدو مبين إنما يأمركم بالسوء والفحشاء وأن تقولوا على الله ما لا تعلمون",
      "O people, eat the lawful and good from that on earth. And do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed he is to you a clear enemy. He only orders you what is evil",
      "and shameful, and to say of Allah what you do not know. When it is said to them follow what Allah has sent down they say nay we shall follow that which our we found our fathers doing. What even though their fathers understood nothing? And they were not rightly guided? So Allah SWT is addressing humankind",
      "all people. Allah has created for you beautiful things on this earth and eat that which is halal. Of course there are many things that I create but not everything is halil so eat that, which is Halal and who makes halal and whom makes haram? This is the authority of Allah.",
      "Those who make halal what Allah has made haram or make haram what Allah have made halal, that means those who make permissible that which Allah has forbidden or forbidden what Allah had made permissible. They are following the footsteps of shaitan. They have no authority to do that. It is Allah so follow what Allah says",
      "what Allah says. And Allah has made certain things halal for you. Halal means permissible, good, allowed. Halāl. Tayyib is even furthermore emphasized that this is good for you So halāl is permissible and tayyibis good healthy enjoyable all of these things so you make sure that if something is halal also it",
      "also it is not stale, it is rotten, it's not infected. So you have to take tayyib that means wholesome healthy good and if it is halal as long as it is fresh and healthy it will be good for you so take that and there are many things that are halal and good so take from that",
      "Eat from that which is on earth, halal and tayyib, permissible and good. And do not follow the footsteps of shaitan. Now later Allah SWT will give us some rules on that but this is a preparation for those rules that are coming. That means for the rule that are",
      "They're all for your own good. And Allah does not forbid you that which is good for you, but Allah forbids those things that are not good for You. So halal and tayyiba. And halal & tayyib who makes halal? And who makes haram? That is the authority of Allah. So do not follow shaytan. وَلَا تَطْرُّوا خُطواتِ الشَّيْطَانِ Do not follow the footsteps of shaitan",
      "Shaytan going ahead of you and you following the shaytan. What does shaytān mean? That is, you make him as your leader and you come at his footsteps. Shaytān's way. Do not follow the way of shaytaan. He is your manifest enemy. Shaytaan did not like human beings from the very beginning when Allah created Adam",
      "Adam and Allah asked angels and all those who were there to bow down to Adam. The angels bowed and respected and honored the human being except Iblis. Ibliss refused, and he refused out of arrogance. He said, I am better than him. You created me from fire and you created Adam from clay.",
      "clay. So I'm better than him, my race is better than his race and so he refused. He refused and he showed arrogance, kind of an al-kafiri and became a kafir. And then when Allah asked him to leave, he said give me a time and I am going to mislead the human beings. So Allah gave him a time",
      "time and he is going to show his animosity towards the human being. He did not like him, jealous of the human beings and he will continue to show that. And yeah this is a test from Allah. Allah gave him the permission to do that but at the same time Allah said My righteous servants they will have you will have no authority over them. They will not follow you",
      "they will follow the teachings of the prophets of allah so shaitan is my enemy in the shaytan and take him as your enemy do not take him with your friend do not",
      "Why? Shaytan only orders you what is evil and shameful. So, shaitan is to direct human being, to tell the human being to order the human thing to do evil things that are bad and also think that they're shameful",
      "that is indescent not good fascia is everything that a person does not want to be known that he was doing there it is recognized by people that this is evil so these they could be sue is in the in the things and fascia in actions so he tells",
      "and also do the acts that are indecent and shameful. And also say things about Allah without knowledge, when taqool ala allahi ma la ta'lamoon That is saying in the name of Allah that Allah did that, Allah said that, without knowledge. Based on knowledge yes you say that but not without any knowledge out of your own whims",
      "zan and tahmeen do not make assertions and claims that this is what Allah wants. And that's how people were misled. Some people came and told them God said that, but actually God did not say that. So they said things without knowledge. So whenever you say anything about Allah, make sure that it is from Allah. It is from the book of Allah.",
      "from the Prophets of Allah and when it is said to them follow that which Allah has revealed, Allah sent down by His Prophet to his prophet. When it is set to them, follow what Allah has sent down they say nay we shall follow that",
      "their fathers understood nothing and they were not rightly guided. A very important point that one should keep in mind, Quran reminds about that. That follow that which Allah has sent down. Even though your forefathers, your traditions, your culture may be different. So don't say that this is my culture, this is",
      "my parents, my grandparents, my forefathers they have been doing that. Yeah the forefather were guided following the ways of Allah and the prophets of Allah you follow them so Quran on one hand says do not follow all the traditions of your forefothers but at the same time say follow the tradition of your father Ibrahim. Ibrahim was the messenger of Allah",
      "Messenger of Allah. So he was also an ancestor, so this meaning is that not every ancestors tradition you follow but follow the traditions of the righteous ancestors those who have aqil and hidayah la ya'aqiloon ashayn wa la yahhtadun if the forefathers ways are not the way of reason it's against",
      "then you cannot just simply say that we have to follow them because the forefathers used to do that. No, pay attention, think. Think yourself is this rational? Is this reasonable? And if it's reasonable yes. Is it something right good beneficial good can we call it a guidance or we call",
      "nothing to do with guidance. So yes, you can follow the...you can do the Taqlid of the righteous people, of the guided people not the misguided people so it is not everything that is of the past you follow but also have some discretion and distinguish between the right and wrong.",
      "way of our culture, this is the way of all forefathers. That's not the right approach and that's not a good argument. The argument is it is something that is coming from the authentic tradition, it is reasonable, it leads to what is good.",
      "Even though their forefathers understood nothing and they were not rightly guided. I mean, there are all kinds of traditions. There's all kind of cultural habits. So not every culture habit is good but try to take what is good and leave what is not good. That is the principle in Islam",
      "principle in Islam, take what is good, what is pure, what it right and leave that which is not mixed up with the good or bad. So don't take the bad. Don't take that which foggy and unclear. That's what Aql means. Use your Aqal, your mind, your reason",
      "wisdom and also the way of hidayah, the way guidance. The prophetic way is the way aql and the prophetic way the way wisdom. Islam does not say that religion is against the aqal. And that's what we call it our scholars say aqil and naqal",
      "the mind, the reason and also the revelation. So reason is a revelation. If the revelation is authentic and reason is sound then there will be no contradiction between the two. If you see any contradictions between reason and revelation they could be one of these things either the reason is not sound or what is claimed to be the revelation it's not the real revelation",
      "it is not authentically reported so if the hidayah and aqil are used, then you can follow that. So these are the important principles that one should keep in mind when taking the previous traditions. One point also mentioned is that when you take the right food",
      "take the right food then you follow the right way so the prophet said as reported by abu hurayra",
      "In Surah Al-Mu'minun, Allah says in Ayat 51",
      "eat the good things and do the good deeds. So when you eat the Good Things, Tayyib, Halal things, you will do the right actions also. The right actions will come because if your body is nourished by that which is Haram, Ghuziya bil Haram is nourish with Haram then how can that we'll do the righteous actions? Righteous actions",
      "one should always make sure that the one is eating the right food and feeding his children her children with the right foods so that they grow up with awareness of Allah and do good deeds but if the food is haram and you think this is a minor issue it's not a minor issues it becomes serious issue because then after that actions will become bad",
      "actions will be combined. People start behaving in the right, wrong way. They all of them go together. Allah Almighty has emphasized this. Eat that which is good and halal and do not follow the footsteps of shaytan. And if you eat the halal inshaAllah you'll not",
      "and your actions will be the rightest action. So there is a connection here between the two.",
      "The parable of those who reject faith is like someone to scream to that which does not hear, accept a call and",
      "Accept a call and shout. Deaf, dumb and blind they do not understand. O you who believe eat of the good things we have provided for you. Eat of the Good Things We Have Provided For You And Be Grateful To Allah If it is He Whom You Worship He Has Forbidden You Only Carrion Blood And The Flesh Of Swine",
      "Allah is often forgiving, most merciful. What a beautiful message here!",
      "example of those who do not want to follow the path. Prophets come and remind them, give them reasonable message, the message of guidance, but they don't listen. The prophet is telling them, reminding them, but",
      "and saying for the sheep, come. And they don't listen. So we're acting like animals, like behind. So Kamasali, is the scream of a shepherd to bring his sheep there. The prophet is the one who is calling, he's screaming, telling, come, come to Allah.",
      "Allah. Listen and they only listen what? Dua and Nidaa, they are listening the call and the shout but don't understand what they want to pay attention to that. Dua is when you call somebody who's near, nidaa is you call",
      "they do. They don't listen except dua and nida. They dont listen any except call, shout, scream but they don't want to understand what is being said. So Prophet's call goes on the ears that do not listen, they do not understand. Wasmaa ghayla musmaiin. That is they listened but they're not really listening",
      "They are not paying attention. This is the example of acting like sheep, like herd. The Quran has given an example of people who have the message of Allah but they don't pay attention to the message. It's like donkeys carrying loads of books on their backs and because",
      "And because the donkey has a lot of books on his back, doesn't mean that he is now a great alim. A very learned person, a scholar. Donkey does not read the book. He does not pay attention to the book, cannot. Or in another place, the Quran has mentioned,",
      "Whether you have put something on the back of the dog, his tongue is out. And if you don't, still the tongue is not out. So it is acting like... The Quran says they are like animals but even worse than that because Allah's message has come and a beautiful message reminding them but they don't pay attention to that message",
      "The example of those, the parable of those who reject faith is like those who receive their scream but they don't hear except a call and shout. And they are acting deaf, dumb, and blind. They have ears but they",
      "They have mouth, but they don't speak the right words. And their eyes that they don see. So that's why it says. Quran has used this expression several times. People act like that. They act like deaf, dumb and blind. They don hear the truth, they don speak the truth and they don' see the truth.",
      "So they do not understand. They don't understand the reality, and do not know what is right, how are good things to be followed. Then Allah says, In the previous one He said, So the message was for all people, all human beings, that this was to everyone. But then Allah now addressing the believers",
      "addressing the believers because believers will listen to allah's message and pay attention this message although allah created good things for everybody but uh the believers are those who will benefit from that so Allah said",
      "believe of the good things they have provided for you allah has provided this from allah he's the one who created he is the one so eat and then be thankful to allah when you eat then you say alhamdulillah",
      "Alhamdulillah. Thank you to Allah. Alhamdullilah alladhi at'amana wa saqana wa ja'alana muslimeen. Thank be to Allah who gave us the food and gave us drink and made us Muslims, believing in Allah. That's what we say after we finish our meal. We begin our meal by saying Bismillah. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. Allahumma barik luna bima razaktana wa qina azabun naal. In the name of Allah, the most merciful, the compassionate.",
      "O Allah, bless us in that which you have given us and save us from the punishment of the hellfire. That means the people who eat are grateful to you. So when you finish your meal, you say Alhamdulillah. Thank me to Allah. We thank Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. We begin in the name of Allah and we conclude with the thanks of Allah subhana wa ta'ta'ala Eat good things.",
      "Don't eat the khabisat. Don't get bad things, eat good things. Allah has given you that and plenty of good things available. And be thankful to Allah because if you are thankful to allah then the food is going to bring blessings upon you. You receive Allah's blessing it will be physical physically you enjoy the food",
      "enjoy the food but spiritually you'll also enjoy the form and the food will create good a good sense good spirit in you good mind so be thankful to allah if it is he whom you worship if it",
      "Only be, only worship Allah. Don't worship anybody else. So if you truly worship Allah then you show your thanks to Him and eat good things. And good things are going to make you thankful and make you worship better. And then Allah SWT mentions in summary although these things have explained further",
      "Surah Al-Araf and other places. Allah says, So Allah has forbidden you don't forbid things yourself but what Allah has forgiven you is that you don' t eat carrion Carrion is an animal that has died its natural death And you found a dead animal somewhere",
      "don't eat it or you find an animal that is uh that was attacked by a wild animal by a lion by tiger was wolf and then you found part of it there don't need that so that is because you don't know in what condition that is",
      "or you find that it is slaughtered properly. Dead things, dead animals, or an animal fell down from a hill. The Quran has mentioned that. That which has fallen down from above,",
      "has been attacked by another animal that which died because of somebody throwing a stone and by that the stone was killed or you found an animal eaten up by some beast. So those are haram, we should not eat that. So all of this come in the category of maitha,",
      "dead flesh but rather you slaughter the animal, you prepare it in the right way and the second thing is do not eat blood but dumb. So blood is not good so don't take that actually when you slaughter",
      "That's why we slaughter in the right way. We slaughter in such a way that we don't cut the whole neck of the animal, but leave back of the neck connected with the life stem and so that helps in gushing out all the blood from the body. And do not take that. Dumb is forbidden.",
      "is forbidden, it's haram. But the Prophet says Allah has allowed for you two kinds of dead that are fish and locusts. So ahlalakumul maytatan wa d-daman The two kinds",
      "So when it's fish, you don't have to slaughter the fish. Just like you do with sheep and cow and camel. Even if the fish is, you find a dead fish as long as it is good, it is not rotten, you can eat that. And also the locust. Locust is small",
      "that come in a large number and that is permissible to eat. You don't need to slaughter them, you just take away the feathers and then eat that. Even raw can be eaten, permissible. So Prophet said there are two kinds of dead that are permissible, fish and locusts. And the two kind of blood",
      "So blood is permissible. That means two parts of the body that have a lot of blood, you can eat them. One is the liver and other is atthahal, that is spleen. You can eat that. So liver and spleen",
      "It contains a lot of blood in it. So that is permissible. And if after the slaughtering of the animal, some blood is still there because it doesn't have to be totally dry. Some blood is there. That is not the flowing blood. I mean, that is not",
      "blood so that's a small blood that remains the small quantity of blood that means in the body in the flesh so haram alaikum will make them dumb the flowing blood double maso that you should not take that and velama and thus the flesh of swine the flesh",
      "ham or bacon, or any other thing. They don't take that and it is not only lahm but also the shaham, the fat of the fish, the fact of the pig so anything that comes from the pig is forbidden one cannot take that one cannot eat that",
      "and then also the animals that are sacrificed in the name of other than Allah, they've been offered to idols or other beings that are invoked in the Name of Allah. Sometimes people used to make sacrifices in the names of some saints, in the Names of some gods and goddesses they used to believe in so offerings that were made for",
      "made for idols, offerings that were made for anyone other than Allah. Offerings are supposed to be only for Allah not for anybody else but if the offerings are made for others then they become haram don't take that sometimes people may bring whether the animal sacrifices or food that was made as an offer to the idols",
      "And it is not allowed for Muslim to take that. But if somebody is compelled by necessity, that means one was starving to death, no other food available and one will not survive neither desiring nor transgressing",
      "transgressing. So he is not going to take that food which is forbidden out of desire, does he like to eat that? No! It is only because of necessity you want to eat it. So his desire is not there. Baagh in also could mean the transgressive, the rule of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala and then going beyond the need",
      "So one can take for survival, one can something that is forbidden but not beyond the need of this for the survival. Beyond. Take only few morsels that can make you live and then try to find halal. Only for that purpose allowed. In a similar way if something is haram",
      "thing is haram, forbidden even as medicine only take it when it is necessary to take and do not take beyond that so whatever is that some I mean that is the haram medicine is permissible only in the case of there is no other halal medicine available",
      "matter of life and death, then in that case it is permissible to use that. But again only through the point that one is healthy and not beyond that. Allah says so there is no sin on him. There shall be no sin if he does that. The meaning is still haram. Haram is haram always.",
      "But taking it is not sinful. It is because of necessity. That's a very beautiful point. That is, somebody is taking something out of... Compelled by necessity, out of necessity, not going beyond the limit and not desiring to have that, to do that, then in that case there will be no sin. But if there is a desire in it",
      "in it the intention is that I like let me enjoy it, let me see how it is. Let me taste it then it is bakawa It is turning away from Allah and then also beyond the need if you go then there is Ism otherwise there is no Ism because Haram is Haram always Haram. Haram does not become Halal",
      "Haram remains haram, but it is allowed under certain conditions. And in those conditions, if they fulfill the condition, then there is no sin. Inna Allaha Ghafoorur Raheem. Allah is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful. And then Allah SWT says,",
      "أولئك ما يأكلون في بطونهم إلا النار ولا يكلمهم الله يوم القيامة ولا يزكيهم ولهم عذاب أليم أولائك الذين اشتروا الضلالة بالهدى والعذاب بالمغفرة فما أصبرهم على الناर ذلك بأن الله ندل الكتاب بالحق وإن لنختلفوا في الكتابي",
      "Those who conceal what Allah sent down of the Book and sell it for a paltry price are those who eat nothing but fire in their bellies. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. This shall be a grievous punishment. They are those",
      "who have purchased error at the price of guidance and torment at the prize of forgiveness, how daring are they to enter the fire. That is because Allah sent down the book in truth but those who differ concerning the book have gone too far in dispute.\" So, Allah's message should be given to the people",
      "those who conceal the message of Allah they know what is the truth but they don't tell it to other people so whatever truth you know say and if you know something is wrong then you say it is wrong don't do that because somebody gives you may give you some money or you may get some benefit and so because of that you hide the message",
      "the truth and say part of the truth. Say all the truth, nothing but the truth Do not hide, do not conceal the message of Allah So those who do that, الذين يكتمون ما أنزل الله Those who conceal that which Allah has revealed from the Book ويشترون به ثمن قليلا And they try to get benefit out of that",
      "they barter it for a small price. Of course, any price is small because you cannot say that all right if somebody gives the big price, it's okay. Now whether big prices or small because there is no price. There is no wealth nothing even somebody gives you billions. It is a little thing because on the day of judgment it is going to bring hell",
      "and punishment and that will be forever so yes this is a poetry prize the small thing that you get even if you get the whole world it is quality small thing so those who do that they are the one whatever food they will take that is nothing but hell",
      "They are filling their bellies with hellfire. And Allah is not going to speak to them on the Day of Judgment. Speaking to them means speaking words of kindness and love. Allah speaks to the believers, to the righteous people with compassion and kindness. He says, peace be unto you. You are good people.",
      "Allah is not going to speak that way. They will hear the words of anger, the words harshness and He does not give them another chance. And they will have severe punishment, their grievous punishment painful punishment. Why? Because they preferred error",
      "error over the guidance. Because they purchased error at the price of guidance. Allah's guidance was there and they gave that guidance and took the error. So it is, that means, a horrible bargain. It's a horrible business",
      "that you have guidance and instead of guidance, you take that which is wrong. And this is not going to benefit you. وَالْعَذَابُ بِالْمَغْفِرَةِ And the punishment at the price of forgiveness. Allah's forgiveness was there but they are the ones who prefer that. اشتراوا الطلاة بالله That means they preferred the error over the guidance and preferred the punishment over the forgiveness.",
      "forgiveness. How daring they are to be ready for fire! Some of them say, I don't mind, I'll go to hell. Can you endure that? Can you put your hand for a minute in the fire? Can",
      "and you say that you are going to take the fire of hell from us may Allah save us from that may Allah protect us from their fire so what how daring are they how full are they to be to to say that I'm very idea to take",
      "Allah sent down the book in truth but those who do not take the book, those who argue about the book they have gone far away extreme in their disputes and their arguments so take the Book of Allah understand the Book Of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala and follow it that is the reminder again and again the Quran reminds the people",
      "the people that come to the Book of Allah and listen to the book of Allah. So we have here starting with Ayah 168, the point is given that eat that which is halal it is good and that will take you to the way of Allah save you from the way",
      "what is haram it's only in halal don't make haraam what is made halal sometimes people make haram things so as it is forbidden to make halal what is Haram, it is also forbidden to do not say things about Allah without knowledge and also Allah says that",
      "given you good things so take the good things eat the good thing and be thankful to Allah. And there are four things that I mentioned that are forbidden, the dead animals, the blood, the swine flesh and that which is offered other than Allah. Now",
      "also in some other places has mentioned some other animals that are forbidden so those are uh some details that are mentioned in the Quran and other places but basically, the basic categories of these four and within this category there are details that given and then mention that if you are under the situation of necessity",
      "that is necessity to render the forbidden permissible so only for that time it is you are allowed to take it and then there will be no sin but again the condition is not trying to enjoy it and not trying",
      "And then Allah says the message of Allah should be declared and be given to others. And do not take error in the place of the guidance of Allah.",
      "it is for our own good. It will benefit us here in this world and it will certainly benefit us in the Hereafter. So we can take any questions that you have at this time. Dr Siddiqui, we have a question about food and sweets that are prepared by people of other religions if it's prepared in the name of idols",
      "of idols or other gods is it okay to eat? Is the ruling for meat only, is there any differentiation between meat or sweets? No. It's not only I mean if it is something offered to idols even if it vegetarian you cannot take that because it's offer to either offerings",
      "is not allowed to sacrifice animals in the name of other than God. In a similar way do not make offerings in the Name of somebody else. Offerings are only for Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala and if something is offered there some sweets, for example sometimes they as a prasad when they give it one should avoid that because Muslims are not supposed to",
      "offering for the idol dr sidiki you meet with a lot of people from the interfaith community what's a nice way for muslims to refuse such offerings if a friend from another religion wants to share some sweets what's the nice way to politely refuse what do you recommend i mean you can say that this is um we only make offerings to allah to god almighty not to anybody else",
      "Our religion does not allow that. That doesn't mean you're condemning them, you are simply saying this is not permissible to us. We cannot take it. This is also mentioned in the Christian tradition whether they follow it or not but in the christian tradition also is mentioned there that do not take things that are offered to other than God and the Jewish tradition also has that so this",
      "of those who believe in one God, monotheists, those who do not take the food that is offered other than Allah and do not make an offering to other than",
      "is taken and all monotheistic religions have that tradition. Dr. Siddiqui, on the issue of meat what if it's been slaughtered without having any name being mentioned at the time of slaughtering? Is that permissible to eat? If intentionally or not does not mention then it is not good one should that's why Allah ﷻ says",
      "is not mentioned that means need not mention intentionally but if somebody forgot at the time of salam for god to mention the name so as long as the slaughtering is done in the right way and then it's okay so do not uh ignore mentioning",
      "Ignore mentioning the name of Allah. And why you mention the name Allah? You mention the Name of Allah because taking the life even if an animal is forbidden and when you mention The Name of ALLAH, you remind yourself that I'm not taking this life in vain. I am taking this Life because ALLAH has allowed me to eat the meat of the animal and because ALLah has allowed Me to eat of the animals so that's why only for that purpose",
      "doing it. I'm not doing it for just to enjoy killing an animal so it is not for entertainment purpose, it is for the purpose of my need that i want to eat that's why i do that and Allah has allowed me to do that so that's Why we slaughter and we mention the name of Allah otherwise even abuse of the animal is not allowed in Islam and when you do the slaughtering, slaughting has to be done in the right way",
      "with the sharp knife and mentioning the name of Allah. And of course, the animals that are permissible. So you have both animal is permissible to eat and slaughtering is done in the right way. That is they call concept of halal. And if no one's name is mentioned then we have to find out whether it was",
      "I mean somebody then who does not believe in God or if somebody knowingly believes in God but forgot that. If somebody forgot that, sometimes you are slaughtering a lot of animals it is possible that you forget so in that case assume that one has in mind mentioning the name of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala Thank you, thank you Dr Siddiqui.",
      "So I will share some information, just some reminders at this time. I'm happy to share with our online viewers that we are now at 975 sponsors for the Power of 2020 and you know with all the recent challenges instead of 2020 we set the target just for now at 1000 sponsors so",
      "and we are still in the month of Shawwal so consider donating perhaps on behalf of your elders loved ones that have passed away or simply just as a means of charity but go to give.isocmuzzuq.org and inshallah will be meeting that 1000 sponsor target very soon now many of you are aware and perhaps some of you have been coming to ISOC",

And there are capacity limitations as you all know. And of course once you are on site, you will be asked whether you are experiencing certain symptoms,",
      "quite to wear a mask and if you feel you are more vulnerable due to various health conditions then certainly by all means please pray at home and know and believe that it's perfectly okay to do that but for complete rules and guidelines and to register visit prayer.isocmasjid.org",

      "may Allah remove their pain, their difficulty and give them complete full and speedy recovery inshaAllah. Also pray for sister Fatima Begum and sister Aisha Bolat they passed away",
      "jannah allah forgive them bless them give them the place in jannah and give patience to their family members and keep us always on the right path as long as we live we live on islam and when we die we die on iman on faith"

      "أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم",
      "رب الشح لصدري ويسر لي أمري واحمل عقتة من لساني يفقه قولي الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله وعلى آله وصحبه إجمعين ثم ما بعد السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته نبدأ درس سورة المزام",
      "Surah Al-Muzzammil, we're starting the verse of Surat Al- Muzzammal number 73. And this surah SubhanAllah one of the most beautiful suras of the Quran describing the balance between The inside and the outside of the believer through the character of the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam It begins with one of them the beloved names of Rasulullah Aleyhis Salatu Wasalam Al-muzzamml is actually the mudghum form of the pattern Tafa'ool it's al mutazzammil that becomes al muzzammil so that taa and za become fused together",
      "So you get مُفَّعِل which is actually متَفَاعِل originally تَزَمَّلَ يَتَزْمَّله is the verb Anyhow, the word مُزَّمِّل or تَذَمّلَ actually means المُتَلَفِّف بِثِيابِه The one who's wrapped up in his clothes Wrapped up in a garment, in a blanket something like that And this term is used for the Prophet ﷺ For a number of reasons One of them is of course He's resting at night and he's wrapped-up in his garment And Allah uses this as a loving nickname for the prophet",
      "someone who's wrapped, you know, oh the one wrapped in the blanket get out, stand up and in the next surah we're going to see someone who is covered up not wrapped up but covered up so someone who has covered up is more snug they are more comfortable so alludes to comfort actually refers to covering or draw something over yourself",
      "most of the night stand most of this is the prophet's instruction he has been given for qiyamul layl for tahajjud prayer for us tahajud prayer is additional it's nafila it's mandatory on him at least a half of it or take a little away from that just a bit",
      "So he's giving him options. Do at least half, a little short, a litttle more or even go on top of that and recite the Quran in slow rhythmic clear enunciated fashion.. Calm down and recite it make sure you give every syllable its due Make sure every letter is clear That is what",
      "That's what Tarteel is, when you slow down and really take your time reciting every word. And this is supposed to be the spirit of Qiyamul Layl Now let's talk about the irony of this The spirit of qiyam al layl is that you're supposed to recite Quran extra slow And qiyama al layli became an institution in Ramadan Because we call taraweeh which is actually we call it tarawih Okay? That something instituted by Umar",
      "He facilitated it for Muslims because so many Muslims have to work and do other things. He acknowledged that, so an hour-and-a-half two hours you can be done but the spirit of it was again the Quran's injunction for this extra prayer The point is you have extra time The point Is you don't have...the day's activities are done You have extra Time now So when you recite Quran recite it extra slow But what do we have? How long did they take? Well they can finish in 25 minutes That one takes 45 minutes We actually have speed records For Taraweeh",
      "In masajid. How many I can finish 20 in like... The Hufaaz talk to me, I can finished 20 in 62 minutes flat. I finished the whole Quran in a week. How quickly can you recite a Juz? Don't even ask bro. I broke my last record. And then the irony of all ironies",
      "We get to the 29th juz. And the kids are in a hurry because it's like the 26th night and they have to finish Qur'an by the 27th, because somehow some revelation came that we don't know about, that by the twenty-seventh night the Qur'aan should be finished so that then the next three nights you recite, when Fatiha is done everybody says Ameen. Subhanarabbika Rabbil Izzat Ya'ma yasifoon Allahu Akbar. Second rakaah Wasalamun alal mursaleen Allahu Akbar",
      "And the next Torah, walhamdulillah. What are you doing? What is that? Just finish the Quran. Get it over with. Even if we don't finish the entire Quran. If we just... You know, pray 20. Go ahead. But pray 20, waratilil qur'ana tartila. Pray 8, pray 10, pray 2. But prayed properly, man. Don't make a mockery of it. Nobody, even people who understand Arabic don't understand what's going on.",
      "Even somebody who knows Quran is not... What just happened? You know, you just floor it and you go. And this is not Quran. That's not what the spirit of it is. مسجل Okay? وَرَتِّلِ الْقُرْآنَ تَطِيرٌ Recited in slow... And that's specifically قيام الليل. Specifically. In other words, you can recite Quran at a normal pace. Not speedy pace but a normal",
      "salawat but allah went out of his way to say when you recite qiyamul lay slow it down and then there are who recite slowly the beautiful voice recite slowly and the people complain can you speed it up a little bit that was like you know you're going under the speed limit a little so if you could just step it up",
      "In the middle of the Salat. The Prophet is given this Salah in the middle, half the night. How much Quran was revealed? This is one of the earliest Suras revealed, you know that? This was within the first 4-5 Suras. Some say within the 7th Suras were revealed. Surah Al Muzzammil. Earliest, earliest, earliest revelation. The question is he's gonna stand there reciting half the Night, a third of the night, at least 2 or 3 hours. At least!",
      "How many Juz is he reciting? It's not even a half of Juz yet. It's Not even 10 pages yet, of Quran. The only full Surah revealed so far must have been Fatiha. Complete Surah reveal. Other passages here and there. If something from Surat Al-Alaq, Surat al-Muzzammil, Surah al-Madathir, early revelation it's a longer Surah relatively but that's it! And he's going to recite that half the night which means you",
      "Which means you have to recite the Qur'an and repeat, and repeat. You know? And you have go recite it again. And just make two rakaats with those surahs, you don't pick a new surah, you go back to the same surah again. Recite it again because the point of Qur'aan is that it has to enter into your psyche. It has to run in your blood as I keep saying. It's not just something you know, it has enter your soul. So why does it have to penetrate you like this?",
      "Why is the Prophet ﷺ have to be trained like this in the middle of the night? إِنَّا سَنُلْقِي عَلَيْكَ قَوْلاً ثَقِيلًا No doubt about it, we are going to bring you into contact. We're going to throw onto you a word that is extremely heavy. قَولاً ثَّقِیلًا A heavy word. شَاقًّا عَلى المُكَلَّفِينَ مُكالَّفٍ It's gonna be very heavy for all those who have responsibility. Meaning the responsibility is about to be given to you to go deliver the message outside. To take it public.",
      "It's not going to be easy for you. And to get that strength, you will gain that strength the closer you are to Allah, the stronger you'll get. And you'll close to Allah when you recite His words calmly in the middle of the night and then Allah starts talking about the benefits of the Night Prayer. Why specifically the nighttime? إِنَّ النَّاشِئَةَ اللَّيْلِ No doubt about it this getting up in the night هِيَ أَشَدُّ وَطْعًا It is more firm when it comes to planting your feet. In other words there are no distractions.",
      "There's nobody else calling you, there are no other obligations. The world is asleep. Your feet are planted more.",
      "Your feet will get imprinted where you stand. You'll be planted, you'll be firm. And this is actually imagery, kinaya in the Qur'an. It alludes to something. And the illusion here is when the Prophet's feet are planted in the ground and prayer his feet will be planted when he stands by his message. اِثْبَاطُ الْقَدَمِ We say وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وَانصرْنَىٰ عَلَى الْكَوْمِ الْکَافِرِينَ Plant our feet firm. Well, you become firm in your beliefs and firm in you're delivery and confidence",
      "So the best time to talk to me is then. وَأَقْوَى مُقِيلًا ثَبَاتًا وَرُسُوخًا فِي الْعِبَادَةِ إِنَّ لَكَ فِى النَّهَارِ سَبْحًا طَوِيلٌ No doubt for you in the morning, there's a great deal of activity. تَصَرِّفًا وتَقَلُّبًا في مُهِمَّاتٍ In all your missions and the instructions I've given you, you have a lot of sabah. Sabah literally comes from sabaha, swimming. And when somebody's swimming they can't just...",
      "I gotta pause this, because this is gonna happen again. Hold up, hold up,hold up... So what was I saying sabh means? Swimming! When you're swimming can you just stop? You're swimming, swimming, like okay Relentless activity is called sabh.",
      "You have to keep going. And even if you're in one place, you gotta keep pedaling. You have stay afloat. That's the nature of your work in the day. A long day full of relentless activity. Make mention of the name of your master. Make mentioned of Allah's name and cut yourself off towards him.",
      "off. It's lazim to cut somebody off that is now what's the conundrum here? What's the riddle here? Tabattal ilaihi, what's tabattalan but it says tabattal so there's actually both combined here we were expecting",
      "And the other option could have been Neither one is used. It's a mixture of both. There's a linguistic discussion, really not appropriate for this series but at least a brief mention is warranted here. When the مفعول المطلق is from a different family and the فعل is from another family and they imply two different things then that's the Arabic way of combining both meanings into the phrase.",
      "You disconnect yourself and connect to Allah only. And by doing so, you will help others disconnect themselves and connect with Allah only.\" You will set the example of how to disconnect others. So it's not just for you. When you become the model of Qiyamul Layl everyone after you will come in your own following and the billions that will come after you that will want to connect to allah will now have a legacy. So you're not just doing this for yourself. That's Tabteel. If it was just for himself",
      "It goes,. Impact yourself, impact others. SubhanAllah! Now in this the Prophet first of all is cutting himself off from society and Allah says you have a lot of work in the day but there is a connection between the two. There's a connection and we'll see that connection in its paired surah. Its sister surah is the next surah But here I want to share with you the foundations of da'wah The spiritual foundations of Da'wah when calling people to Allah",
      "to allah the golden rule you have to and i have to remind myself of is my whatever comes out of the heart goes into the heart that was not speeches that was no talk there was not knowledge that way somebody who feels something to the core of their being and then that that conviction comes out in the sincerity with which they share it with somebody else",
      "sense the sincerity. They can tell the genuine nature of what you're saying. And that has, that sincerity itself has an impact. You know the Prophet ﷺ didn't just teach the truth. He had an aura of it. There's something about him, around him he says those words, you could tell he means them. Can you tell when somebody gives a speech and they're absolutely convinced of what they're saying? And when somebody",
      "It has to become yours. It has come from your heart. Well, it can't come from you until it goes into your heart first. That's the night time. That is when the message goes into the heart. رَبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمغْرِّبِ لَا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ The master of all...the entire east and the entire west. No one is to be worshipped and obeyed in any way shape or form except He. فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلًا Then take Him as the One who takes care of all your problems. The disposer of your affairs if you will.",
      "الوكالة To leave the issues in somebody's hand. توقّل comes from it. I'm just relying on Allah. Let him be the one you rely on. وَاسْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ And be patient over what they're saying. Now Allah tells them, Be patient over What they are saying. Because even though I've mentioned this concept before In my Tafsir series of Juz'a Amma It is a very powerful concept in the Quran A Prophet has two conversations He has conversations with Allah and he has conversations With the people",
      "with Allah is beautiful and it's empowering. And it's rejuvenating but the conversation with the people is ugly, it's offensive, it insulting, it hurtful. And he has to have both conversations. But one conversation gets him ready for the other. You run out of steam when you talk to people. It's depressing. Why would I want to do this? Why would you want to talk to somebody that insults you? What could possibly motivate me to do that? They already insulted me the day before.",
      "They already question my integrity as a human being. Why would I want to do that? Why would i want to put myself in that position? Allah is teaching His Messenger, the only way you'll be able to put your dignity on the side, and this mission is more important than your own dignity. You go back to Allah and you humble yourself before Allah at night, And then you will remember that no matter how much they put you down, That does not take your respect away. I've given you the honor. Honor comes from me. Now this is easy to talk about but to apply in our life",
      "Why in our life? Oh man, that's tough. You know you talk to somebody about deen and they insult you. You're like I'm never going to talk to that person. That person is a jerk. I am never going talk to them again. Forget that. I'm not going into their house. Who do they think they are talking to me like that? Now imagine who are we compared to the Messenger. If somebody insults the Prophet, if there's any human being that was in a position to say",
      "If there was ever a human being who was in that position, it's our messenger ﷺ. Who do you think you're messing with? Do you realize what I'm sharing with you where it comes from? You realize the kinds of connections I have? This is the last messenger of humanity. Do you realise the consequences of not believing in me?\" And when he hears that kind of insult, he can't be just turned off and move on.",
      "because it's critical. There are different kinds of people with different levels of sensitivity, so you have people that are I don't know how else to put this scumbags they're just foul-mouthed dirty corrupt people that used to hearing filth all the time. They utter filth and they hear filth, and they're surrounded by filth. People like that when you curse them out what happens?",
      "Yeah, and what? That's all you got? Now let me give you mine. And then they'll show you how, you know, they got their training from sailors. You know? But then on the other hand, you have decent people. Respectful people. Respectable people. People with a decent upbringing. They go to, you",
      "and they treat others with respect, and they expect that they will be themselves treated with respect. So when you go into your office, you don't mentally go prepared to hear curses or that somebody is going to make fun of you or say something about you that's obscene or use dirty language with you. You don't expect that."

      "First of all, thank you everybody for joining. We received a lot of questions from you already from the online forum and that will get us to get our discussion going during this meeting we'll also take some questions from your via chat as well as try to take some voice questions as",
      "from within Zoom at the bottom of your screen there should be a chat option. You can send a chat question to if you want everyone to be able to see it, you can share with everybody. If you wanted to be private, you could direct it at Sister Sabia who is one of the co-hosts and we'll try to get to as many of your questions as we can but as we mentioned we've already received quite a bit so we'll reserve some for future sessions. Also just one more thing I just wanted to just remind everybody",
      "everybody that you know I associate is doing a lot of work right now still trying to provide services during this time and we do have some ongoing expenses so encourage everyone to still give generously at donate.isofcmudget.org So, at this point in time we will hand it over to Dr. Siddiqui",
      "there. Dr. Siddiqui and Sister Sabia, why don't you go ahead and start asking the first question? Yes. Assalamu alaikum, Dr. Siddiqi. Waalaikumsalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. Thank you for joining us this evening and thank you to our participants who are also joining. So Dr.Siddiqui if we may begin with can you explain a little bit about what is fiqh? What is this word that is so important in our lives as Muslims?",
      "as Muslims. Say it again, I did not hear what is that? What is fiqh? What does this actually mean and how does it relate to our life? Yeah, Islam you know is a deen, it is a complete way of life and Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala has given us rules about",
      "about personal life, about our belief, about acts of worship and how to live in our lives, in relations. Relations to ourselves, relation to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, the relation to the family, relation with a neighbor all different kind of relations that we have so guidelines are given to us in the Quran",
      "Prophet and this is called Sharia that is given by Allah. Then our jurists, the Fuqaha they categorized the rules. That is what is Fardh and what is Mustahab, what is obligatory, what",
      "not recommended and what is just halal that it is up to you, do it or not do it. So these are the categories in which the rules are divided and this is the work that was done by the Fuqaha on the basis of the principles that we have in the Quran and the Sunnah so Fiqh is the development of understanding the Quran",
      "light in our life. The word fiqh literally means understanding and this understanding is done by our jurists actually it is coming from some of the rules were laid down by the Prophet himself and then after that Sahaba, how they lived their lives and then further elaborations came by our Jurists such as Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal and a number of others",
      "So that's how fiqh developed and so we have various mazahib, schools of fiqhh that Muslims are following. Some people are Hanafis they follow the fiqha of Imam Abu Hanifa and his school some of them follow the Fiqh of Imam Shafi'i and his",
      "or do not limit themselves to any one of them, but they go to... They say that they follow the Quran and the Sunnah. And they call themselves Ahl al-Hadiths or Salafis those who follow the salaf, that means the elders of the community. Thank you. Dr. Siddiqui in light of the current situation",
      "those who are working in the health care, are asking do they need to fast this Ramadan? Especially if they themselves have some kind of a health issue. If there are doctors working in hospitals, nurses, healthcare providers, in order to keep their own immune system strong should they forego",
      "Should they forego fasting this Ramadan? Allah says in the Quran, Who is our witness the month of Ramadan should fast. Must fast. This is a command of Allah and then Allah says",
      "or on journey then make up those days after Ramadan. So do some other days not in Ramadan if you are sick in the month of Ramadan, or you have having a journey during the month Ramadan then you are allowed not to fast during the months of Ramadan but you have to make it up call it Qadaa Now in the current situation",
      "Those who are healthy and can fast, of course people are at their home. Instead of going to work and spending the time outside and wearing a normal one, many people are not working and they're at home so it's not that difficult for them to fast. They should fast if they are healthy but if they",
      "not too many people are traveling now so in the hardship or sickness then they are allowed not to fast but they have to make it up later. Now, the hardship case is especially for those who are in the risk category older people especially the older people",
      "diabetes, heart condition, lung problems, kidney problem things like that then we recommend that they should consult their doctors and find out whether it is you know they should fast or should not fast if their doctors recommend that They should not Fast then they are allowed not to fast.",
      "and if they cannot because of their health condition, they cannot make it up the whole year or even later then they are allowed to give Fidya. Fidyatun ta'amu miskeen that means for every fast that they miss during Ramadan they pay compensation for that and the compensation is one day's meal for each fast that",
      "that they missed. So it estimated almost about 12 to 15 dollars per day and they pay that amount if they cannot afford it then they ask Allah's forgiveness, if they can not afford it they can't afford it. Allah does not impose any person any burden beyond their capacity so during this",
      "virus condition that is or in any condition this is the rule that those who are sick or under hardship they should check with their doctors one case is uh in the case of physicians who are attending the patient who are was the patients of coronavirus",
      "physicians if they see that it is necessary for them to have their throat moisture and they have to take sip of water or some other thing that you have to do in order to develop the immunity because we don't want to see the doctor get sick so if that is necessary then this will be considered as a case of hardship. And in",
      "not to fast during the month of Ramadan but they make it up later after that so that will be a special situation for those who are sick, Allah has already given concession and Allah has given them the option that they make up later. And other thing is that of course during the",
      "fasting, they should pay attention to the month. They only drink and eat when it is necessary try to control because out of respect for Ramadan they should do that and also in public they should not eat but down some private place and there they eat so they give some kind of respect",
      "they should pray regular prayers and try to do more itilawa, more dua, more dhikr of Allah SWT. And if they can give some charity beyond the kaffarah, beyond the fidya then they should do that also. Tarabeef prayer, everybody, massages are closed so people will not be able",
      "to come to pray in the Tarabih prayer in the Masjid, they should listen to the Quran. If masajids are broadcasting through Zoom or some other method you hear the recitation of the Quran from the Qari of the Masjed or from the Hafiz of the masjid it is good to sit down and listen to it",
      "not praying because there is no virtual prayer. Prayer of Jama'at is only in the place where the Jama'ats are. They cannot have a Jama'ah in their homes, they can make their own Jama'a and in that Jama' if somebody knows the Quran, can recite it, they should recite the Quran. If they don't know, they recite short suras",
      "surahs. The last ten suras for example a lot of people know them by heart, Alam Tareqaifu Fa'ala Rabbuka Bishabhil Fiil until Surat al-Nasr these are 10 suras so they recite 10 surah and again they recite ten surah if they want to pray 20 rakah or if they only want to do 8 rakah then they can do that and after",
      "and ask Allah to remove this epidemic that the world is suffering. So, thank you Dr. Siddiqui. We're just going to switch to some family issues now. What do families do who are arguing at this time or anytime they're in a fight? They're refusing to speak to each other for long periods of time",
      "time, what should other family members do to reconcile between relatives that are fighting? This is very important. That if something like that is happening it is the responsibility of the other family member's to reconcile, to understand, listen to both sides as Allah SWT says in the Quran",
      "problem for Basu, Hakamah min ahlihi wa hakama min ahlihi. Let someone from her side and someone on his side come and they talk and then after that they try to make reconciliation and if they do that Allah SWT will bless them. So sulh the reconciliation bringing peace and harmony this is the responsibility of",
      "that they should not neglect them to their own if they themselves cannot solve their problem and they see that the couple need uh to see a professional counselor they should seek the help of the professional counselors uh the people in dispute they should go it is their responsibility also",
      "the nature of the problem that is and everything can be solved if they have their will to do that. The solution can be done, and it is the responsibility of the people in dispute. They should not prolong their dispute. Try to solve it as soon as possible, and other people should try, we should help them. That is important. However, if it does not work out then",
      "then we should try to avoid that. But the last resort is going to the court and get the decision made there, Allah knows best. This should be the last result. There should not be violence in the family. And they should absolutely avoid that domestic violence is a big problem. Not only in Muslim families but all families it's happening today",
      "happening today. So that is something that must be avoided, it's a crime and they can end up in jail and they may lose their children who are there in the family so Muslims should avoid that absolutely no family violence.",
      "what is the status of creating a prenup in Islam? Is it allowed and specifically can the husband state that the wife must share expenses equally in the prenup? Prenup is good. Prenups are both sides agreeing to certain conditions, certain rules and they should follow them",
      "if the wife is making money and she spent time outside the home eight hours work she's doing or whatever amount of what she's then she should contribute something depending on how much she is making and how much he is making it is possible that she is",
      "so whatever it is of course the primary responsibility in the expenses is that your husband is supposed to provide for the wife and the wife takes care of the home, take care of children but she's not just at home. She is outside working",
      "then she should be contributing something to the family expense unless husband says that no whatever you are this will be yours and you can spend on yourself or your family or keep it uh you can use it as your saving uh then of course that's okay so this is uh this matter is flexible in this and it should be a mutual agreement mutual understanding",
      "understanding. And what are some of the like, how can you guide families particularly on the issue of having a second wife? Does the husband need to get permission from his wife, from his first wife? That means the husband wants to have another wife? Yes.",
      "Well, I mean the Sharia allows that. Whatever Allah says nobody can stop it, nobody can say no. However having a second wife is not obligatory. Nobody is... nowhere in the Quran or Hadiths it is said that you must have more than one wife. The Quran says",
      "deal with them justly, then you should have only one. And those who are living in America, American law does not allow multiple wives. One cannot have two wives or three wives or four wives. The law here does not allowed that. So that means one wife will be the legal wife and other wife will illegal wife and this is not justice. This is not equality.",
      "So for this reason, it is better to abide by the law of the land and not to have another wife. And if somebody really feels that he should have another life then should try to migrate to the country where it is allowed, where they are allowed that. So the position is that if you are living here I mean this is not something that you can say well",
      "well, it is a violation of my religion because religion doesn't say that you have to have second wife. It is something called mubah permissible and in some cases it is not permissible if somebody cannot do justice to the second wife so yes it is allowed but should you practice or not practice? I would say that do not practice that here if you are living in America",
      "but if you are, if you want to practice it then you are free to choose some other land, some other place to go there. Unless the law changes in America that is a different case. Thank you Dr Siddiqui we have some family concern where",
      "is trying to encourage them, but the father doesn't think it's anything of concern and he feels that we don't need to force the children to pray. And that eventually as they get older much older they will pray. What can families do to kind of collectively encourage their children to",
      "on time? Parents are the role model. They should pray and if the children see them from a very early age that when the time of prayer comes, the parents pray and they come and join them. They love it to be with their parent at the time",
      "you know when uh when a child is born in the muslim family they give adhan in the ear of the child and it's not that they're calling the child to come and pray they are simply putting this so any kind of symbolic way that the child is",
      "indication that this is the family of prayer. So pray in your homes, as the Prophet said don't make your homes like graveyards but some prayers you should do at home and children should see that and ask them to join from a very early age sometimes children become four years old five years old they come",
      "They might be simply playing and they might be Simply imitating but this is good. And when they are seven year old then they should be encouraged to pray and When they become ten-year-old Then you insist on them that they should pray and remind them and tell them come and pray Now if you neglect all these and then they are 15 years old 16 years old, and then you will tell them that come and go and pray",
      "or go and pray, very often parents themselves don't do but they just tell their children go and play then you will see that they are not used to it. They did not see very much so they will try to avoid that there is runaway they will say yes and then after that they won't do it or maybe they'll do it one time two times and then",
      "them sometimes the importance of prayer how good it is, how beautiful it is. How much they will be blessed Allah will be pleased with them if they do that these kind of nice advices in a loving and caring and kind manner I think they'll penetrate into their mind into their souls and they will become the best even if they pray and then sometime",
      "and don't become too angry, start shouting and scolding and doing all of this kind. No! There has to be a loving way of doing it. So wisdom and kindness and beautiful preaching that is you start from home. Same thing if the spouses are negligent in prayer,",
      "If husband doesn't do it, then wife can remind. If the wife doesn't, then husband can remind So you should remind each other and then also pray to Allah SWT Lord grant us from our spouses and from our children the happiness of our eyes And make us the Imam, the role model for the righteous",
      "you know in the quran wherever allah has said that uh that the children should do something or there is dua of the parent for their children first is the dua for themselves Ibrahim says",
      "That is the way the Quran says. Luqman gave to his child, pray. So that is the command that is given there as well as the Dua from Allah SWT",
      "that make our children those who observe the prayer and if parents do that diligently nicely with sincerity devotion with love and care and children start praying then a lot of reward for the child for the parent because these are the children when they pray then after that they will raise their hands",
      "Allah forgive me, I forgive my parents. So children will pray for their parents and this is the sadaqah, ajariyah. The Prophet said when a human being dies his actions come to an end except three things. The charity from people's benefit and then ilm, the knowledge that he leaves and people benefit from that knowledge",
      "and the third is a righteous child who prays for the parent. So that is the beautiful way of doing it, that you yourself pray and remind your children so their children observe the prayers. Dr Siddiqui thank you. Staying on the topic now of our youth",
      "What advice can we give to our sons, especially the boys? Young boys who want to wear earrings or other pieces of jewelry. Or perhaps they just want to clean their eyebrows a little bit as this is getting more common. What advice could we give them? Yeah, this is something on which we have to work and our children",
      "our children growing up in a culture where nobody can say anything and people just do whatever they want to do we have to remind them that there is an Islamic culture, there is Islamic way of life, Islamic way appearance, Islamic dress. Yes there is no special dress in Islam but",
      "the rule general rule is that male should look male and female should look female uh allah's curse is upon those men who try to imitate women and alaska is on those women who try",
      "that we have to follow that and we have imitate that. We should not imitate everything but rather whatever is allowed to imitate, whatever is allowd to do you can do that. But Allah and his prophet told us that there is a male appearance and female appearance so Islam says men should have beard",
      "Manly clothes and women have hijab. And they should have their clothes accordingly, and they can wear golden jewelry. They can have all the things that men should not wear the gold and jewelry.",
      "in their men's clothes look beautiful and women in their women's clothes looks beautiful. That is the Islamic way. So this is the message that we should give to children. Of course, if you make a hard and false rule then they will say why in the Quran it is said I cannot wear earring? Why in the Hadiths it is that I can't do that? There are general rules. The culture of Islam, the way of appearance of a Muslim",
      "That is what we have to pay attention to. Not just where is the rule, where it's said that and it is not a matter of halal or haram It is a matter taste, it is a manner of etiquette, adab.",
      "are mortgages permissible and if people do have existing loans on their property can they still go for Hajj? Will there be Hajj valid? Can you speak a little bit about the financial aspect of it, involved. I mean one can buy home on installment",
      "that it is permissible, it is also permissible to add some money because of the delay in payment this called Al-Ba'abil Ajal suppose something is a house for three hundred thousand dollars and one is not paying 300 000 dollar to the seller you can say that I'll give you uh this amount",
      "this amount in 10 years and the seller says well, in that case the price will be not 300 000 it will be 350 000 or 400 000. So he's adding the amount of 100 000 or 50 000 for the time because the time value of money is recognized in Islam and there are some Islamic mortgage",
      "mortgage program, Islamic financing program. And that is based on that I think this is a good to use that one should be careful that what is the how the terms are made or what is it? How the contract is made but that is permissible and can choose that so the alternates are available by different groups and one can do some shopping on that university finance guidance many other group that are there",
      "group that are there, one can look at that and take benefit of this. If one finds that these groups are charging too much or they're saying you have to make larger down payment and one cannot afford that then in the case of necessity some of the scholars say that one can have one home for his or her own residence",
      "and they can have conventional mortgage for that. That is in the case of necessity, but one should not keep on having more and more homes on mortgages and borrowing money from the banks and paying their interest. That's something that one should never do. And the second point is if somebody makes Hajj while he owes or still paying some mortgage what is the situation?",
      "enough money to make Hajj, although you still are paying to the bank, the mortgage, the Hajj is still for you. You have to make hajj if you have money unless you don't have any money and you pay off your loan and then after that nothing left to cover your expenses then it's okay then the Hajji is not obligatory but Hajj",
      "because people sometimes have big amount of money in their bank account and they're still paying loans. And for the loan, they pay a small amount monthly agreement that they have with the bank. They pay that amount and it's still they have 20 thousand 30 thousand in their Bank so then they should make Hajj. Hajj is obligatory anybody who has Nisab I mean",
      "who can afford it. If a person has financial and physical possibility then one should go to Hajj, and Hajj will be acceptable because of one thing the other thing is not being cancelled. Dr Siddiqui talking now about life insurance, is it permissible to get life insurance?",
      "and if somebody has had coverage for many years should they cancel or should they just continue with the coverage since they spent many years paying for it? Life insurance is something that did not exist at the time of the Prophet or the early history of Islam. So, it is something",
      "and so it is a question of ijtihad. And there are two opinions, some very respectable scholars and ulema they say it is not allowed because it has resemblance to gambling, it has the resemblance of deception, gharar, it had some riba in it, some interest in it. So because of that they say",
      "they say that life insurance is not permissible. They say health insurance, property insurance, auto insurance, these are necessities but life insurance it's not a necessity so you should not have it. But the other very prominent scholars and",
      "such as Mustafa Zarqa and others, they said that no. You should avoid the ribah if there is a ribah component not there but it is... As far as the gharab, there's no gharabs because here you put down the basic terms clearly on that so it will not be considered haram. So Muslims should have Islamic insurance companies",
      "insurance companies and there are some Islamic insurance companies based on the Islamic principles one can insure with that. If there is no insurance company available, and a person is living in a non-Islamic environment and they have to protect their money, they have protect their family and they want to have insurance, they're allowed to have an insurance in that situation",
      "situation. So life insurance is a controversial issue but there are scholars, respectable scholars who say it's permissible and one can do that but we should avoid the river as much as possible. So again in light of the current situation the government assistance offering loans on low interest perhaps",
      "would it be okay for small businesses who are suffering at this time to take advantage of those loans on a low interest? Yeah, if there is the as I said that if it is for your own personal home not for buying property after property on interest so whether it's a small amount",
      "interested in trust and it should not be taken. What about the businesses right now that are suffering because of COVID-19? Small businesses are having to close down. Yeah, people in this situation said yes if they're hardship situations they can do that and they can pay off after that but that's a hardship situation.",
      "principle in Sharia that if necessity renders the prohibition permissible. They think that are forbidden, they may become permissible under the necessity so if people in order to have their business, in order",
      "and there is no other way they can have it, then they can take it. And I think our Islamic finance group, they should try to see if they can provide a reasonable kind of loan because sometimes they say they put it in the Islamic terms but actually they charge much more",
      "Okay, we're gonna take a question from someone dialed in. Sajida Sultani wants to ask a question. Please go ahead, Sajidah Sultany.",
      "I mean, among the people who die. But how can we make sure that the bodies are not burned or they're not thrown in a mass grave or something? Should we Muslim community gather a lot of signatures either through CARE or Islamic Shura Council which are the two big organizations and present it to the government",
      "to the government, to say that the bodies of those people who pass away and are of Islamic faith should be returned to their families. And how can we... I mean, should the fiqh community that you're part of it Alhamdulillah, and some medical groups get together and see how this can be possible? There is a lot of concern in our community about",
      "everything is like so confusing and we hear conflicting messages of whether the government is going to give it to us, what kind of situation that the body's gonna be in, whether it's contagious or not. And whether they're gonna give it us or not? Bottom line I'm very concerned with a lot of other people are very concerned in our community too as to what happens to the body. If the body is burned",
      "Is that something we can accept or should we just get together and like put some kind of petition on? Or what is your advice? When a person dies, there are four things that Islam says that you should do. Number one is the washing of the body. That's called ghusl al mayyad The second thing is shrouding of the party, kafan",
      "The third thing is Salat al-janazah. And the fourth thing is the burial. In the case of the situation that we have, that is coronavirus situation, if somebody dies with infection",
      "then one has to see what are the rules, what are laws in that. The laws probably will not allow washing of the body if the washing of body is not allowed you can do tayammu If the body really has to be covered and nobody can touch it",
      "and they put them in the body bags as i saw uh in one of the videos that somebody sent me very something that frightening because there are hundreds of bodies in body bags in new york and there was a big truck there standing and taking these bodies in in a truck so uh that um if",
      "if that happens and may Allah save us from that but it is something that might come. And so there is no possibility of washing, tayammu with the body in the bag and you cannot do anything then this is no then there will be no requirement I mean there because",
      "to see if you can have the body available for burial. If the body is available for a burial, then have salatul janazah and of course the cemeteries do not allow too many people maximum 10 people they allow or sometimes even less than that. Then whosoever prays janazha, they can pray janazhah in cemetery",
      "cemetery and the rest of the people do Salatul Ghayb. Salat al-Ghayb is permissible according to Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal it is permissable that means they don't have the body in front of them but they pray in their homes even one person can pray so there is no, not a requirement for Jamaa",
      "you can have whatever number of people there, they pray Salatul Janazah. But we should try collectively Muslims to say that in our religion the cremation is not permissible so we do not cremate bodies and I think there are also some other religions such as Jewish community especially the Orthodox Jewish community",
      "community they don't do that so it is something through coalition's through working together we hope that you can get the exemption if it is you know this is this is something that we have to work on so first three that is the washing of",
      "There is some relaxation in the rules on that. But as far as cremation is concerned, that is to be avoided absolutely to be avoid it and one should work on that yes I agree with you that this is something that requires our organization work together on that so we work together",
      "other people can be involved into that. People of interfaith community can be in order to do that, some of them because some Christian groups who are not mine to do but as far as the Jewish group and Muslim group they can work together on that. Dr Siddiqui is it permissible for women to visit the cemeteries? To visit the graves of their loved ones? Yeah I mean the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam in the beginning",
      "beginning he forbade everybody males and females to go to the graves that means not for I mean burial we will go but after the burial whether they go or not it was in the beginning it was forbidden but then the Prophet said I forbid you",
      "visiting the graves, but go ahead and visit them because they will remind you of your Akhira. Now the Prophet did not say only for men that it should do that, men and women both. So women can go if there is safety for them, they would go with a proper dress covering themselves properly and",
      "spend a lot of time there sit down and cry and weep and do all these things bewailing no you simply go and say peace be unto you oh the people of the graves you are you went ahead of us and will follow you may Allah forgive you and forgive us and then leave spending too much time and then especially going with",
      "going with, you know reading the Quran sitting on the grave or bringing flowers and candles and all those things. These are bid'ahs, these are things that are not allowed but simple visit is okay and it should be that she should go with some males, mahram people or husband should go in there with the people because it is not good to visit just by themselves",
      "I mean, if it is safe for them they can but it is better that they should go with some other people or several women can go together. They can do that so i don't see any prohibition because I mean some people in some countries prohibit them completely but there is no absolute prohibition for women. They are discouraged but they are not forbidden",
      "Okay, Dr. Siddiqui we're going to switch now to the topic of dreams. What is the ruling on the interpretation of dreams and should we share our dreams with others? I mean dreams are everybody's dreams. I mean some are nightmares that you should",
      "That is, we should ask Allah SWT to protect you from that. And if you have a frightening dream then you turn to the left side and say la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah and then turn to right side and sleep. But it's nice to have good dreams and depending on some dreams they come true and some dreams don't come true but",
      "when the Rasulullah sometimes used to interpret the dreams. Yusuf was given that knowledge of interpretation, Taweer-e Roia. So some people have that knowledge and they give you the interpretation of dreams a lot of people don't have it so if somebody does not have that",
      "should not interpret the dream and there are certain rules and certain etiquettes of doing that so may Allah protect us I mean this is something that we cannot explain completely science of dream has not developed very much that how it happened that somebody before things happen have some kind of a pre-vision of that but some dreams they come true yes Rasulullah",
      "Rasulullah before the Nubu'ah and he had that, and he said that this is one of the 40th part of Nubuwah. That is the Prophet after death became the prophet of Allah but then Allah gave him that knowledge even before that, that he used to see the dreams and those dreams were as if he's seeing things in the morning as it what he saw in the",
      "So Quran mentions dreams of especially in Surat Yusuf, there is a lot of discussion about these dreams. Dreams are true yes and Taweel-ul-Roya is the knowledge that some people have. And Tarshtiki can you recommend any books on the interpretation of dreams?",
      "There are several books on the Italian Arabic and some of them were translated for the interpretation of dreams. I can't recall at the moment the names of some of these but there are some classical books of Ta'bir al-Ahlam",
      "or the serial ahlam you know one can check that uh and some islamic bookstores and you can see that but again i mean this is something in which people have to work more and try to go to the classical literature",
      "but one cannot deny that there is a reality that one can foresee in dreams. Thank you Dr Siddiqui, just one or two final questions. Can a person read the Quran without wudu? And also if a person suffers from incontinence how can they offer prayers?",
      "You can read the Quran without wudu, it's not required that you have to have wuduu in order to read the Qur'an. It is good to do that but the question is can you touch the Mus'haf? That hold the copy of the Qurana in your hand and read the Musahaf without wadhu. Most of our scholars say that Allah says in the Qurán la yamassuhu illa al-mutakharoon",
      "Although the ayah talks about angels, but it is also applied to human beings. So that's why it is emphasized very much that mushaf you don't touch it without wudhu although it's not haram, it is not forbidden, but if it is very highly emphasized to touch the mushaaf with wudu and especially you sit down for tilawa then you should be in wudh",
      "and should be given high respect that we should do that. And the Quran should be recited in respectable places, don't recite the Quran in the bathroom, don' t recite the Qur'an while you are having a shower but you have your dress up, you're wearing proper clothes and then sit down in a respectable place",
      "place some people even say that you your face should be toward the table but that's not required you can do that you can whatever they sit down and do the tilawa with that and full attention then it will bring the blessing of Allah SWT. The people who have some sickness and some problems such as incontinence problem",
      "in that situation you can even pray without somebody make wudu clean oneself that is the privacy cleans oneself and then put on some kind of a diaper or something so that it would not leak and urine does not go out",
      "coming out still you can pray it's called salasul bowl that is the urine parts of the urine little is coming out so if you have that then one can pray similarly if somebody has a problem of um the wind passing and they cannot control that they can pray also but they have to make wudu for every prayer",
      "and then when the next time comes for prayer they should make wudu again and clean themselves. They clean themselves and then make wudo so it is that is the Salat al-Azhar, the people who have uzra, the People who have excuse for them which is allowed just like we pray in the standing position and if you are sick you can sit down you could pray in",
      "in lying on your side and pray so prayer is important to those who can purify themselves clean themselves make wudu yes they should do because there is no salat without unless there is an excuse if you have an excuse you don't even have to make wadu then you just make the emblem",
      "Even if after tayyam mum, somebody has some drops of urine then because of sickness not because of negligence one did not thoroughly clean oneself and dry oneself but if it happened because of the sickness and this is a constant problem then it will be permissible. If it happens one time by accident then they have to go and wash themselves and make kudu again because even one drop of urine",
      "of urine that will break the vodou or wind will break. Thank you Dr Siddiqui finally as you know a few days ago we heard about the passing away of our young sister after a courageous battle with cancer now at the funeral very few members of friends and family could be in attendance",
      "be in attendance. Can you say some words about a loss of a child to console the family? Yeah, that is it was sad. Are you mentioning this brother who passed away recently? No sister, the young sister that passed away. Of course anyone that passed",
      "but just to console the family, the loss of a child in Islam.",
      "that will come from that so pray for the deceased ask allah's forgiveness for her forgive her overlook her mistakes and give her the high place in jannah inshallah and may allah give patience to the family members",
      "and especially the difficulty that we are going through. We don't know who is going to die because of this spreading of the virus. I don't about myself, anybody else. May Allah protect us and protect our families and give us patience, give us support",
      "seek help of allah with prayer and with patience thank you thank you dr siddiqui for your time we are fortunate to learn from you right from the comfort of our homes may allah bless you inshallah would like to join you in dua",
      "All the one who is living, all the one whose of sitting.",
      "our affairs good and help us improve our conditions for Allah. Allah do not leave us to our own soul, to our only efforts even for the moment for the twinkling of an eye. Allah be always with us and help and support us and protect us and our families, protect our community and remove this affliction from humanity. Allah remove",
      "remove this virus from the existence and you are the one who has all the power we don't have all the powers, we are weak our scientists our armies our forces none of them can defeat it and it is spreading all over the world and hundreds and thousands of people are dying oh Allah have mercy on them have mercy",
      "Just a reminder listeners of programs coming up you can join over zoom or facebook this friday april 3rd NYG are going to be sharing their poetry skills plan to join them at 7 45 pm then on saturday April 4th",
      "discussing the significance of the month of Sha'ban and ways to prepare for Ramadan. And please remember that recordings of all online programmes are posted on Facebook.

      "arrogant the vain glorious and in surat al-infar allah says so fear allah and set aright the relations among yourselves obey allah in his messenger if you are believers i'm going to speak about the subject of relations building relations maintaining relations",
      "Human beings need to relate to each other. The famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said that human being is by nature social animal. Whether you agree with him about human being as animal or not, but we all agree that human beings are social. We are social, we need to related it to each",
      "other we have to build relationships and in Islam it is highly emphasized in Islamic ethics that is called host no more Asherah good relations living together nicely and Islam emphasizes that just as Islam besides that you should have a strong belief faith",
      "that you have a bad worship of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala your faith in Allah and your sincere I rather devotion to Allah subhana wata but the third important aspect of Islam is good relations social ethics so social ethics is part of Islam and Islam wanted",
      "Respect and honor of the parent. Good relation with your spouses. Caring, kind and loving relationship. Trusting relationship between their spouses. Good relations with children. Be kind to them, caring for them. Good relationships with all your other relatives. You have a whole network of relationships.",
      "brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts many other people grandparents grandchildren all of them so your relations with others other relatives and then your neighbors your co-workers people human beings Muslims non-Muslims people of any race any color any nationality Islam is against isolationism",
      "Islam is against racism, Islam is again xenophobia, Islam with the against intolerance, Islam against hate. All these things have nothing to do with Islam. Islam came to bring good relations between the people that is the message of Islam.",
      "relations human relations are as much part of islam as there is a bad part of Islam five prayers a day fasting in the month of Ramadan zakat and hajj these are very important but also relations among the people good relations is as important as anything else you know the famous hadiths of the prophet",
      "Somebody came to Rasulullah and said that there is a woman. She prays a lot, she fasts a lots, she gives a lot of charity but she has very bad mouth. She speaks and hurts the neighbors. When she opens her mouth, she's hurting her neighbor. The immediate response of the Prophet was",
      "she'll go to hell or she is in hell because of her behavior even though she prays, she fasts, gives zakat, all the charity and everything but her relations are not good. And then they mention about another woman she's not known for a lot of prayers, not a lot fasting and she gives even small piece of cheese",
      "She just gives little cheese to the people for charity. Not much charity. But she does not hurt her neighbors. She is kind and good to her neighbors, and the Prophet said, she'll go to Jannah. See the emphasis of Rasulullah came to emphasize this point",
      "point that you should be very good to others and not only in a reciprocal manner, that means somebody do good to you and you do good for that person. No! Not only that but it's the ethics of the Prophet is do good even to those who do not do good",
      "with you connect with those who don't want to connect with you you see the hadith of the prophet my lord has told me about nine things and i'm going to tell you that keep that in mind this is my wasiya this is",
      "أخبرني الله عن 9 شيء يجب أن تكون حقيقياً، بما في الحالة أو بالفعل",
      "In front of the people or alone? Sincere, pure in my intentions, in my relations, in feeling towards others. To be just whether in anger or in happiness and to be moderate whether in riches or in poverty And then he says to connect in my relation with those who try to cut me off",
      "My relatives who want to cut me off, I try to connect with them. I try have some good relations with them and do my best. To give those who deny me, who deprive me. And to forgive those who do wrong to me.",
      "My mind is used to think about Allah's creation, and my relations with other people. And then in speech when I speak, I speak mindfully. When I look at things, I take lessons. So this is the prophetic guidance,",
      "The prophetic ethics is give to those who do not give you. Now people tell you if somebody doesn't give you, don't give him. Actually take away things from him. Connect with those who are wrong to you. Forgive those who did wrong to You. It's not easy my brothers and sisters it's not Easy but one should try that in order to receive the blessings of Allah SWT",
      "of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala in order to to be successful in this life and in the life to come and in islam it is emphasized that you should try to be fair and good even to enemies",
      "Oh you who believe, stand out firmly for Allah as witnesses to fair dealings and let not the hatred of a people make you do not do justice. But be just that is next to piety. Be mindful of Allah. Indeed Allah is aware of what you do.",
      "of what you do so be just be fair even to those who are your enemies why one of the very important point one should keep in mind is that Islam says it is quite possible that today somebody's your enemy tomorrow he become your friend so don't give up hope",
      "یہ قدر ہے کہ اللہ آپ کے دنیا میں اپنے ان لوگوں کے محبت سے پیدا کر سکتا ہے لیکن اللہ کچھ بھی کیا ہے اور اللہ ہماری رحمت کو زندگی",
      "In another place, the Quran says, The good deed and the evil deed are not equal. Repel by that which is better.",
      "whom and you there is enmity shall be as if his loyal friend. And who can receive that except those who are patient? So building relations requires a lot of patience, it requires a lots of sacrifice, it means charity, it",
      "الأشياء التي تحتاجها لنبتدأ في علاقة. لا يمكن أن تكون علاقات بسهولة ولكنها قادمة على التحقيق وإذا حصلت عليها فستحصل على رحمة الله العظيم. كان نبينا محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم هو الموضوع للغاية لم يخطئ أي شخص حتى أمامه عندما كان",
      "powerful when he could punish them, he forgave them. There is no one in the history forgive as many people as many of his enemies as Rasulullah gave. Actually he had this art, this style that he would win the hearts of the enemy. People would come to him hating him,",
      "ومن ثم يقولون عندما جاءت أبغى الناس إليه ولكن الآن أحب النار إليها",
      "That's the way of Islam. That is the message of Islam and my brothers and sisters we can never over emphasize the importance of building relations It is always needed and especially in a challenging time in which we are today The whole world is going through Violence and hate and prejudice all of this is going on problem",
      "problems you can see that and especially the Muslim world going through a lot of difficulties Syria and Iraq and Yemen and Egypt and Kashmir and Afghanistan and Pakistan and we name it may Allah save everybody may Allah bring blessings and kindness everywhere but the world is going through",
      "And America is also changing going through a challenging time The people say we don't know Which party is going to win in the election But that must very poison already toxic and it will take long time and I hope it will but it will, but it would change It will change to better inshallah But there are difficulties",
      "There are difficulties. There are forces of hate, forces of Islamophobia, forces xenophobia, and forces of racism that are rampant. May Allah protect everyone. So how can we overcome that? We can overcome it through building relationships",
      "اپنے نسائی کو بہترین آپ کے لئے ہیں اور اس نے کہا کہ میں اپنا فم سے بہاترین ہوں تو آپ گھر سے بھی جانیں اور پھر آپ دوسری مزاجدوں کے ساتھ بھی شروع کریں۔",

We have to build relations with them. And there are a lot of good people. Goodness is not the monopoly of anyone. There are a lots of good People. We've to work with them and we have",
      "We have to see that how we can help the poor, the people who are going through... They have no social justice in this society. How we can take care of them? So we cannot fight alone Islamophobia. We cannot fight all these intolerances that is going on. We have build relations and insha Allah through building relation, working together",
      "معاً ونحن نعمل معا من خلفنا إن شاء الله يمكنك التواجد لأن المسلمين دائماً مستقيمون لا تقنتوا من رحمة الله لا تتخذوا من مرسى الله سبحانه وتعالى الله تعالى يمكن أن يعيد الحالة يمكن ان يكون أفضل لكن لا يمكنكم فقط الملوك والأمرا وبدون عمل شيئ",

      "and also at the same time it says that do not despair, do not say unless I see the fruit of my work what should I want why should I work your job is to work in the right way and the results are in the hands of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala so put your trust in Allah subhana wata'ala",
      "is right, your amal is right. Your deed is right and your intention is right InshaAllah you will see the reward for that. You may be able to see the fruits of your action. Now Faseela is a palm, dead palm seedling. And if somebody put that in the ground it may take 8 years 6 years by the time the tree will grow up and bring the fruit.",
      "and bring the fruit. And here is the last hour, Qiyamah is there. But Rasulullah said no go ahead, let him plant it because it is your action you're doing that will bring the reward. So do whatever work you are doing continue doing good work",
      "but of course in Islam there are priorities. In Islam, there are certain things that you have to do so whatever you do it in obedience to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Action must be based on the Sharia, the principle that I've given to you about halal and haram between right and wrong and then also Sharia tells you what is fardh",
      "and what is Sunnah, and what mustahab, what is halal, what haram, what makrooh. You all get those categories to follow those categories so your priorities must be there you have to understand your priorities and also your intention your intention must be Ikhlas sincerely for the sake of Allah",
      "So, a business sincerely with honesty and truthfulness in the right way then you will see the reward for that. You go to school, go to college your study is there if it's the right intention Inshallah you'll see the rewards for that so that is the beauty of Islam It does not separate religion from life but live your life",
      "Have your family, have your children, have you business. At the same time remember your prayers, remember your duties to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, huqqullah Remember your duties towards your family. Remember your duty is toward the community, toward the people around whom you are living, to your Islamic center, to neighbors Muslims or non-Muslims",
      "Muslims and non-Muslims. And also remember your duties towards the environment, towards the resources, all of these things that are called حقوق الله حقوقة العباد حقوا الشياء حقق النفس All these haqouq are mentioned. You remember that fulfill those and you will receive the reward from Allah. And at the same time, you have to understand that there are priorities",
      "priorities called and they are whatever you do understand what is first and what is after that and then also what are the consequences of your actions whatever action you take understand the consequences pay attention to that so use your wisdom",
      "All of this is religious action. All of these are part of the Deen. The Deen does not take you away from your life, from your business, from activities but actually all of this a part of that. And if you do some of these things, live your life with your family, with your business and work and fulfilling your obligations there will be reward for that. Everything will receive reward for it.",
      "reward for that. Rasulullah said there is sadaqa in everything that you do, you are with your spouse, you're enjoying your family life and this is a sadaquah, this is charity, this good deed. Sadaqah means that you are giving charity to your wife but you are meaning that you have been kind to her and this you receiving the reward for",
      "that Allah SWT mentioned in the Quran number of places but Allah says those who believe and do the good deeds we shall not deny them deny the reward of someone who is best in his action",
      "you who believe and work righteous deeds that he will surely make them succeed in the land as he caused those who were before him to succeed. And he will establish for them their religion which he has approved for them, and he will change them from a state of fear to one of security. They will worship me not ascribing any partner",
      "live thereafter, it is they who are rebellious. Allah has promised that the way of success is to be aware of what is going on, understand the realities, pay attention to the world, education, business, commerce and relations with other people",
      "obligations, your rights of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. If you fulfill that in a most comprehensive way, in a wholesome way then this is the way of success and Allah subhana wa ta-ala will approve that. This is what Islam stands for. So Islam does not say don't do anything just be praying and fasting and all these things",
      "These things are very important, but at the same time say that do this. At the same whatever you're doing make sure it is halal. Make sure it's right. Be honest, be sincere, be truthful. So Tajer who is sadiq and ameen feels like somebody who is working for the cause of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala giving his life for the Cause of Allah subhana wa ta-ala",
      "they are all standing in the same way. So may Allah give us understanding of our faith and make our life, the life of goodness, the live of truth and sincerity and our relations with all people in the right way.",
      "Alhamdulillah, alhamdulillahi rabbilalameen, wassalatu wassalaam ala sayyidin mursaleen, nabiyina muhammad wa ala alihi wa sahbihi tayyebeen at-tahireen. As we are involved in our businesses, as we are",
      "understand what is going on in the world, what is happening to other people, what",
      "protest and we should write to the authorities, the people who are speaking on our behalf, who rule. We should speak to them and tell them what is going on. And there's so many things that are happening in the world. I especially draw your attention to the situation of Muslims in India. There are many other places but at this time",
      "especially. They are the large community of Muslims that are going through a great difficulty and in the state of Karnataka, the state is forbidding Muslim women, Muslim girls to attend classes with hijab and this is the first time happening in India. There's Muslims who like number of Muslims have been living there for centuries now",
      "Now they are not allowed in that state to have their hijab. And this kind of discrimination, which is against the Constitution of India, which it's against the tradition of India is now happening. So it is important that we should be aware of that and express our opinion, send letters",
      "about that tell them what's going on as we do that about Kashmir and they do that what Palestine as we did it what Burma I will do that work China as you do the other places now with the new situation has come back and comes around so it is important that we should be aware of that and should pay attention I pray to Allah swt to help the people who are suffering in any part of the world everywhere",
      "وعلى أمهما فاطمة الزهراء والعميه المعظمين المكرمين عند الله والناس الحمزة والعباس وعلي السائر الصحابة والتابعين ومن تبعهم بأحسان إلى يوم الدين وعنّا معهم بفضلك وكرمك يا أكرم الأكرمون ويا أرحم الراحمين اللهم عز الإسلام والمسلمين",
      "اللهم عز الإسلام والمسلمين اللهم انصر من نصر دين محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم واجعلنا منهم واخذ ظلما خذ لدينا محمدا صلى لله عليه وسلا ولا تجعلنا اباد الله رحمكم الله إن الصلاة تنهى عن الفحشاء والمنكر ولذكر الله أكبر فاقيموا الصلاه",

      "All right. First of all, thank you to the Salam Islamic Center in Huntington Beach for organizing this live stream on the Muslim response to a global pandemic and thank you all for joining. My name is Joseph I'm a student at the University of California Berkeley and I will be hosting tonight inshallah that being said i'd like to introduce our guest for the evening Dr. Muzammine Siddiqui",

He also chairs the Fook Council of North America and formerly chaired the Shura Council of Southern California.

Sidiqi was one of the signatories in October 2007 of A Common Word Between Us And You.",
      "University and Harvard University. And before we move on to the lecture portion of our program, we'd like to begin with a recitation by our beloved Qari Imam Hafiz Hamza of Salam Islamic Center. He will be reciting chapter 42 of the Quran verses 22-47 of Surah Al-Shura translated into English as consultation.",
      "وعلى أهله خبير بصير وهو الذي ينزل الغيث من بعد ما قنطوا وينشر رحمته وهو الولي الحميد",
      "وَمَا أَصَابَكُمْ مِنْ نُصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَा كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُMْ وَيَعْفُو عَنْ كَثِيرٍ",
      "وما أنتم بمعجزين في الأرض وما لكم من دون الله من ولي ولا نصير",
      "فيضلل رواكد على ظهره إن في ذلك لآيات لكل صبار شكور أو يوبقهن بما كسبوا ويعفو عن كثير",
      "والذين يجتنبون كبائر الإسم والفواحش وإذا ما غضبوهم يغفرون",
      "وأمرهم شورى بينهم ومما رزقناهم ينفقون والذين إذا أصابهم البغي هم ينتصرون",
      "فمن عفى وأصلح فأجره على الله إنه لا يحب الظالمين ولمن انتصر بعد ظلمه فأولئك ما عليهم من سبيل",
      "إنما السبيل على الذين يظلمون الناس ويبغون في الأرض بغير الحق أولئك لهم عذاب أليم",
      "ومن يضلل الله فما له من ولي من بعده وترى الظالمين لما رأوا العذاب يقولون هل إلى مرض من سبيله",
      "and ask them then during the Q&A. Without further ado, Assalamualaikum Dr. Siddiqui and thank you for joining us. We can begin whenever you're ready with the lecture.",
      "the Lord of the worlds and we send peace and blessings upon the prophets of Allah all the prophets from Adam alayhi salam to prophet Noah, prophet Abraham, Prophet Moses Jesus and the last I find the prophet Muhammad is given all of them upon their families and on their followers.",
      "thank you especially brother Ibrahim Barlas for inviting me. I want to thank Salam Islamic Center, our neighbor in Huntington Beach area mashaAllah and Imam Hamza for his beautiful recitation and of course Brother Joseph who is supervising this program so masha Allah may Allah bless all of you and all my listeners",
      "listeners, some of them I might have seen and some of the I've not but I greet you all especially I want to give you the greetings of the coming of the month of Ramadan. You know InshaAllah the month will begin most probably on the 24th of April on Friday so we are very close to this very blessed time",
      "نحن ندعو الله سبحانه وتعالى لكي يجعلنا بسهولة ونحن في مرور صعب ومخيف وفي ذلك الوقت قادم للفضاء في رمضان فإن شاء الله، حقاً نحتاج إلى رماضان في هذا الوقته نحتوي على الكثير منها نحتوج إلى رحمة الله نحتوى على المغفرة والمرسية والإرجاع",
      "to be free from the hellfire. So we need all of these things, Ramadan is especially needed for that. So may Allah accept our fast and make this month blessed for us as well as for our neighbors, for whole humanity. And may Allah remove this affliction, this pandemic that has taken the whole world now.",
      "I want to talk about what is our response as Muslims or what should be our response of Muslims also and of course all people of faith not just Muslims, people of the Jewish community, people from the Christian community, People of many other faiths in the world because this pandemic is not limited to any one group of people",
      "Neither it is limited to a race, nor that they are limited to the color of people. Not limited to any country and not limited certainly to any religion. It is almost all world. I mean there are more than 85% of the countries in the world that are in lockdown situation. And that means about 6.5 billion people on earth",
      "they are one way or the other affected thousands have died and millions are now sick and it's affecting economy, it is affecting the social life. It is affecting everything because everything is locked down. The international flights have stopped you look at the airports",
      "And you see as if there is some kind of a war going on. The planes are grounded, battery lines grounded. You go and see the highways, and you see the highways are empty, almost empty. Schools are closed, universities are closed. People are having some program online. Massages are closed!",
      "of worshippers closed. So this is a challenging time, this is unprecedented. Before in the past there were epidemics but they were limited to some region. But now it is all over, it is global and it's global because we are living in a global village because the rapid means of transportation",
      "of this they have made the world as a globe and there's a village so we are in a global village and we are affected so this is affecting everybody this is effecting the very rich and affecting the very poor the people in advanced developed countries country like china that has",
      "country like our country here, United States the most powerful country in the world is affected by that and affected by what? By something very tiny you cannot see it even with a microscope. It needs a very powerful microscope hundreds of thousands times power to see it so this little tiny thing",
      "tiny thing has caused so much chaos, so much trouble. And one of the creation of Allah because everything is created by Allah. So you can imagine the power of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, the majesty of Allah subhana wata'ala because we think that we are powerful, we think",
      "should teach us to become humble and turn to Allah. Now, as you know in Islam we learn that everything has a cause so we believe in the cause and effect and that is the law of causality there are physical laws the laws of physics",
      "physics and there are moral laws the laws of morality and spirituality a lot of people know about physical laws but don't people don't know they won't care about the model laws physical laws as you know the fire burns if somebody fall down from uh from above is going to hurt himself",
      "The water, the fire, all of these are natural things that affect people. Earthquakes affect people, and we know this happened because of that. Accident happens, so what happened? So this is the law of physics. Everything has a cause and effect.",
      "that are hidden, that the religions talk about it. The scriptures talk about and they say that morality has effect and immorality has its effect. Injustice has an effect. Zulm has an affect and sin has an",
      "immediately but it will come and if it comes up that so if you are not going to follow the laws of morality, the law of justice, the laws righteousness then we are going to suffer. And this suffering sometime comes here and it will",
      "you behave in this world, in the right way. So that you don't get into accident all the thing but at the same time also in the righteous way. Right way and the righteous ways both of them. So this pandemic is teaching us we have to learn some lessons from it. And we have",
      "Why it is? Because God, Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala is in power and is in control of everything. Why did He let happen to the humanity? What is the reason? Of course you can say there are environmental problems, other physical problems because this virus came but there is something beyond that",
      "beyond that. So when the Imam was reciting from the verse from Surah Ash-Shura, they say Whatever affliction comes to you is because of your own deeds, because of",
      "the consequences of every wrong thing that you do but sometimes you see that so Allah SWT is saying that there are some other things that are going on and the Quran says the corruption the disorder",
      "appeared in the land and the sea because of what people have done or because what people do so allah make them taste some of the consequences of their corruption of their wrongdoing some of",
      "mistakes, their shortcomings, the wrongdoings. Repent and seek forgiveness and correct their ways. So this is a Quranic way of looking at the world from that perspective. And then Allah says that when people do right things they are blessed.",
      "If the people of the world, if the people have the cities and townships they believe and do good things we will open the gates. The blessings coming from above and blessing from beneath. Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala's blessings come from every direction so good deeds, good behavior helps and improves and bad is bad behavior it brings problems",
      "It brings problems. Brings difficulties. So you might say that, well why so many innocent people are suffering? I mean the wrongdoers we understand the wrong doers are suffering because they are wrong but why innocent people suffering? Because the general effect",
      "effect that's happened here in this world. On the day of judgment, everybody is going to be questioned according to and judged according to his or her deed. So individuals are going to question there on the Day of Judgment but here when there is some kind of a disaster comes, some type of problem, everybody affected by that. This is the world in which Allah swt will judge them according",
      "according to your own deeds on the day of judgment but here everybody included and it is also mentioned in one of the hadith that allah said to the angel go and destroy their township and they said but there is a person there is group of people who obey you, who worship you instead destroy them because he did not do anything to correct that",
      "he did not feel when the people are doing wrong he did Not say anything so good people if they keep silent and they don't correct things they may also suffer because of that Allah protect us from that so these kind of events they should open our eyes our mind our souls and we think about that don't just say there's some people who will say well this is nature",
      "Yes, it is nature but the nature made by whom? Allah. So there's a law of nature but then there's another law that is behind that and those things both of these things are affected and it is important that we should take physical laws seriously for example here in this pandemic there are certain thing that we",
      "Stay home, keep social distance. Don't shake hands, wash your hands, keep yourself clean. All of these things are very important and we should observe them. And then there are scientists who are looking for the solution. They are trying to find a medicine, finding a vaccine. And that's also mentioned by our religion. The Prophet said",
      "Take the Vah, take medicine because for every disease there is a medicine. So yes we have to find out the medicine. We have to figure out a cure and Insha Allah people will find out a Cure. So that's one aspect but there is another aspect that is the aspect of correcting ourselves improving ourselves changing ourselves",
      "century especially, the 20th century and the beginning of that 21st century. I mean there's so much wrong, so much injustice, so many corruption that has happened and people have to think about it. So much racism, so",
      "in many places and nobody talking about those people who are suffering it is very important that humanity come back to Allah and find out what we have been doing how can we improve ourselves, how can make ourselves better people? And if the doctors find a solution for this",
      "some cure is found and people go back, I hope they will go back inshallah sooner to their normal life. And people think well so what? It happened. Well it can happen again. Another problem comes as Allah says in the Quran when they are traveling in the sea and a storm comes around them they say if you save us we will become obedient",
      "He will turn to you and when they reach the shore, they turn away. They forget. So Allah SWT says, why worry about it? Can he not destroy you on the land? Only in the sea can destroy you. Can he destroy you only on the Land or can he not make you travel again in the ocean? So problem can come again.",
      "to start doing right things. Justice must be done and the good behavior is very important, the moral behavior, the righteous behavior. So for this especially in this situation it is very imporant that we find the solution for physical solution for this problem, medical solution for",
      "repent. Repent individually and collectively. And we should ask Allah's forgiveness. And you should ask allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to show us the right path, guide us and follow the right part not just say that show of the right but then don't follow follow the Right Path that he has already shown through his prophets and messengers who came all over the world so guidance is available and people have to come back to the",
      "to the guidance of Allah SWT. So in my view, it is a teaching moment. It's at the moment where all of us we have to reflect and think and correct ourselves and don't think that this is just an episode, this is a phase and that is there and then you go away. No! This are the things that come to bring humanity to the right path.",
      "pray to Allah SWT to keep us on the right path and bless us, bless the humanity and remove this difficulty from us. This is their perspective, Islamic perspective looking at things. This are the Muslims that is so turn to Allah be devoted to Him take care of other human beings their rights it is very important that you take care",
      "and the needy, be charitable kind towards people. And if there are any difficulties, fights among the people try to finish those bring people in peace so that people live in peace within a country and then international peace all of these things are needed. So immediately you have to show more kindness most more care for other people and then of course we have to",
      "course we have to be careful and being very cautious about what is happening, and take all the physical precautions for ourselves. So I pray for Allah SWT to guide us and help us and keep us on the right path.",
      "محمد الله ما لطاقة لنا به واعف عنا واخلنا وارحمنا أنت مولانا فانصرنا على القوم الكافرين يا حي قيوم برحمتك نستغيث لا تكلنا إلى أنفسنا طرفة عين ولا أقل من ذلك اللهم لا إله إلا أنت سبحانك إن كن من الظالمين",
      "These are the duas in times of anxiety, distress and difficulty to return to Allah.",
      "be at this time to become humble. When they see the difficulties and pain, problems, they should become humble and have tadawra. Tadawra ila Allah. That means that is ibtihal ila God. Humbly turning to Allah and asking and praying to Him. So I hope in this month of Ramadan we should do that. We'll do that and may Allah accept our prayer.",
      "accept our prayers, our dua. BarakAllahu Fikum. Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu. Thank you so much for that Dr. Siddiqui. Mashallah very informative lecture this evening. It is now time for our Q&A part of our program and we're getting some of these from social media. Some of them have been asked beforehand",
      "been asked beforehand and our first question is as Muslims what is the best response to this pandemic in our community? Turn to Allah, pray to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala ask Him because everything that is",
      "if trouble comes to you then no one can remove the trouble except Allah and if you have good, Allah has power to do everything. And our Prophet peace be upon him said, Amru al mu'min kullahu khair The believer is always in a good situation If he is in happy situation, he's grateful to Allah thankful to Allah SubhanAllah",
      "and if he is in difficulty, then problem, then he's patient. Patiently, steadfast. So we should be patient. We should not panic. We shouldn't lose hope but we always turn to Allah SWT and trust in Him and correct ourselves. That is the believer's response, believers attitude in a situation like this.",
      "Thank you. And we have another question, it's how does the pandemic bring humanity as a whole closer to Allah? Only time they can come closer is if they pay attention and think about it because Allah reminds, Allah does not force so this is a reminder there are people when they see things they become humble and they turn to Allah",
      "they turn to Allah but there are people who are arrogant whose hearts are hard and they don't take lessons from that Quran has mentioned many stories even some nations when they were under the punishment, they were saying that this is a cloud that will bring us rain. This is just a cloud, this is just",
      "So that should not be the way. We should turn to Allah SWT and remember Him, and be thankful for His graciousness. That is the way then. Otherwise this will go away and people will resume the same lifestyle and this will not be a good thing as if we have not learned any lesson. Thank you! And one from our audience from India",
      "في هذه الوقت في مصر في حالة قدوم المشروع كيف سنقوم بإزالة اعتمادنا ومساعدتنا أكثر؟ من خلال إزالتنا نبات الله تعالى من خلفية قرآنه من خليفة الزكر ومن خلوة مساعدة الأسرة والأحتاجين",
      "And charity removes, especially in the time of difficulty that acts of charity they bring consolation. They bring peace into the heart. So see what can you do? What can you to your neighbors? What you can do for poor and needy people? How you can help other people? There are many ways and there are a lot of people who are suffering",
      "you know and 85 percent of the population of the world is poor there are only 15 or so who are well to do and at this time they're in great difficulty people are starving to death they're going through a lot of problems in india especially you know that is uh the government made the announcement that the lockdown the curfew",
      "curfew and people are not allowed to leave their homes. And suddenly they stopped the transportation, no trains, no buses, nothing. So you see that people are because they're out of jobs, they have to go back some of them were working in Delhi for example, and had to go",
      "to go back to their villages. And some of them were mistreated by the police, mistreated people. So that is a horrible thing that is there. That humanity... People have to learn how to be human, how to treat each other with respect and kindness. And during",
      "So tomorrow is Juma and the month of Ramadan is coming. And when I'm in Berkeley, when I go to university we're always going to Jumaa every week with our fellow students like every week. A couple weeks ago we couldn't go because of the pandemic. Some of my brothers were saying let's try to find another one",
      "another one, let's try to find a different mosque we can go to. And which is kind of not what you're supposed to do but how are we supposed to keep a sense of community as Muslims without Juma every week? Some people really crave that and really want to keep going to Juma and especially Ramadan is gonna be very different this year. So how do we keep a",
      "community going into that? It is difficult. It is because we want to go to our mosques, we want go every day. We want to five times a day if you can. And especially in the month of Ramadan, lot of activities are associated with mosque so",
      "So we go for prayers five times and more people go for prayer during the month of Ramadan. And then in the evening, people have iftar together and then come for tarawih prayers and then people gather together for a'atikaf. So all these things are there. We know that this is going to increase spread this virus more",
      "people are going to suffer because of that. So we don't want to spread the virus, we don' t want to cause problem for ourselves and others. And this is a strange kind of virus you may not know it for a week or 10 days, it appears after 14 days and by that time you might infect many other people. So that's why it is very important that people should be very cautious",
      "very cautious and don't take it lightly. It is doctor's advice, people who have a lot of information or knowledge about that, scientists, they are the ones saying that don't gather within your own family. Yes you can do that but keep away from others.",
      "that six feet social distance that you have to observe don't shake hand keep your hands clean all of these things and this these rules are given to us for what for our purpose for our benefit in order to control this disease so yes islam says that you come into prayer but you know in the time of the prophet there was a rain",
      "and it was probably realized that it will be very difficult for people to come to the mosque so muazzin they give the azan in the process of saying pray in your homes because he was concerned that people are going to come and they're going to be in the murder and some of them might get sick because of that so you say pray in",
      "in your own home, in your place. So this is just for the cause of the murder. What about when there's a disease? So when there is ta'un, when there are plague, when these kind of virus it is important that people should behave very carefully and should yes we love to go to mosque but we should not go to the mosque Friday prayer",
      "and the way that we pray, we stand next to each other. You cannot keep six feet distance. We be next to one another and then we bow and then you put our head on the foreground and you see that if somebody sneezes or coughs so you have possibility of getting catching that infection. After every prayer you cannot remove the carpet",
      "disinfect the whole area and then forget again for the second prayer so all of these things one should keep in mind so the best thing is the safest thing and the right thing is pray at home but you can keep contact with others through phone through um so many social media",
      "And that's what the universities are doing. They're having classes. So, with this we have to do it. Inshallah if you observe this, it will go away. It will go way. But keep your contact with us. Find out how your friends are doing? How your relatives are doing? How other people are doing it? Those people if you know they are not well, they have difficulty then you can see how you can help them.",
      "Insha'Allah this will help. As well as pray for everybody.",
      "they are okay I think in the eyes of God what is the approach that Islam has towards that yeah but Allah SWT has given us and what we call it a free will so we are the one we have to select the way how we behave how we do things",
      "And that's why there is judgment on the Day of Judgment. Here we are not forced, but we are guided. We are told that we should do that. So if you do the right thing then Allah will bless us on the day of judgement and if you don't do then you see the consequences. And if somebody makes a mistake there is a way of repentance ask Allah SWT to forgive. So forgiveness is also possible but forgiveness requires repentance turning away from",
      "away from the other. I mean, there are four things that you should do. First thing is you feel sorry for the thing that you have done. Second thing is that you promise that you will not do that again and the third thing is ask Allah's forgiveness and the fourth thing is if you've done something wrong to another person try to reconcile, try to correct it. If you have taken somebody's money pay it back to him",
      "paid back to him, to that person. If you owe something to somebody do that so this is the way you can reconcile you can take things better otherwise people just pray and they don't do the right thing then the prayer will not affect them you know the hadith of the Prophet in which he said that the bankrupt person is on the day of judgment he said the prophet asked the sahaba do you know who is the bankrupt",
      "And they say bankrupt is somebody who has lost all his money. The person says no, the bankrupt on the day of judgment is the one who prays, who fasts, Who gives some charity but then he accuses and abuses and takes somebody's property and harms this person or that person Then on the Day of Judgment he will lose all of his prayers and fasting and all these things because people will demand and his good deeds will be given to them",
      "given to them and his good deeds are not going to help him. So it is important that we try to clear our record here in this world. And we have another question regarding young people and the pandemic. This person says that young people can",
      "in submission to Allah's will. And they're asking what your suggestions would be to Muslim youth struggling to grasp the wisdom behind the personal or communal hardships and sufferings that we are all going through. InshaAllah, the youth will be... I mean, the older people are more vulnerable with this virus. But it is happening also to some young people. So we pray to Allah SWT to protect all of you.",
      "and keep you safe, and give you a long life, inshaAllah. But the purpose of living is not just living, the purpose is to do good things. Good thing for yourself, your family, people. So make your life a life of value, not just wasting time or energy that Allah has given you.",
      "The Prophet said in one of the hadiths that your shabab, your youth you have to take benefit from that before you become old. And what benefit do you take for your shabaab? That is you improve yourself, you learn, educate keep yourself strong morally and spiritually and physically all these things and intellectually as well so all of these things are very important",
      "So youth, sometimes they forget that. That is you have free time and you have the money at a young age people don't think about anything after that but all of these things are temporary. Yeah yeah definitely that can happen sometimes for our young communities",
      "to our young communities. And I think this is going to be our final question, unless we get some more questions from social media. Do you see like after this quarantine ends when we're able to have social gatherings and Juma and just prayers regular prayers at the mosque? Do you foresee any changes at the Mosque in the Muslim community",
      "community after this pandemic in terms of rituals, social gatherings? Maybe some hand sanitizer at the entrance of the mosque or something like that. We started in our Islamic society we installed end of February we installed the hands and titles but this problem came and then they had to close everything so",
      "إن شاء الله سيكون هذا مفتوحاً ونقوم بإعادة حياةنا ولكنني لا أعتقد أنه سيأتي بسرعة. سيتم إخلاصها بسهولة. يجب أن نكون جيدين بالله تعالى. نشكره ونحمده وأكبر من كل هذه الوقت.",
      "now you will appreciate. In the month of Ramadan, why we are given that way? Because when you fast for 16 hours no food, no water, you appreciate eating food after that. So this time is like a time of abstaining. You cannot go out, you can't eat, you cannot do this, you cant do that. When you come back then you have to understand how nice it is",
      "it is then you appreciate the blessings of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala so inshallah be hopeful and trust in Allah but trust requires effort, trust is not just wishful thinking and it's not daydreaming. Students say",
      "I'm not going to read, I'm no going to work hard, I am not going pay attention to my class but I trust Allah will make me successful. No that is foolishness. So when you are in trust, you work. Thank you, yeah inshaAllah people will hear your words and make changes in their lives. It's been very informative for me and I'm sure",
      "I mean, it's very especially relevant to our current situation going on across the world. It has affected many of our brothers and sisters. So if you have any that will be the last question. So, if you've got any final words, if would like to make dua, the floor is yours. My suggestion is that all of you, all of us Muslims",
      "young and old, males and females. We all pay more attention to our faith, our Iman, our prayers, our righteous deeds, and also reconcile. Don't be divided we should be together, we should care for each other as well as care for other people but we have to start first of all",
      "first of all, correct our own home because goodness begins from home. Each one of us we have to see how I can be good in my family if there are any differences or problems we solve them inshaAllah forgive each other and then our community wherever you are try to work together so I pray to Allah SWT to bring the Ummah together and also the humanity together",
      "All right. Thank you, Dr. Siddiqui for being our guest tonight. We very much appreciate it and thank you to everyone who joined us and asked your questions. And this is weekly we're doing conversations weekly with the Salam Islamic Center",
      "So we'll see you next week and thank you for joining."

      "Welcome back to Diffuse Congruence, the American Muslim Experience. This is episode 124 and I am Pervez Ahmed, your host, and I'm joined as always by my co-host Omar Ansari. Assalamu alaikum Pervez, wa alaikom listeners. It's great to be here. Hope everybody's enjoying their summer. Yeah that's right well summers over schools are back but for some of us yes some of those I guess just depends where you're at in the country that's why some folks are still enjoying their nice summer and others are just back to the grind that's",
      "That's right. And I guess we wanted to quickly give an update to something we had talked about last time, and for those keeping up with the story of our cousin, Asim Ghafoor, alhamdulillah, by God's grace, he is back with his family. He was released and safe and sound with his",
      "Yeah, Alhamdulillah. I think it was a month and end, a month of just probably extreme worry by the family and by all of us who know and care about Asim. So yeah, Alhumdulillah is a huge relief to know that he is back home with his family and healthy and safe. Alhamdullilah.",
      "have on the show. I think Omar and I both wanted to have him on the",
      "the delight and the honor and the good fortune of sitting with Dr. Muzammal Siddiqui, who I consider to be truly one of the giants of the American Muslim community, someone who's been an absolutely tireless leader in our midst, and we have this amazing opportunity to sit with him. And I think what really for me separated when I...I've told you the story, Omar that one",
      "if Zaki and I first started it so many years ago, was really to capture the story of people like Dr. Siddiqui. In fact, you know, I remember even thinking about Dr.",
      "Yeah, I mean, you know, I enjoy all these conversations. You know me, I'm a pretty social guy. I like talking to people and just interacting but some of the conversations also have the added benefit of just spiritual uplift and this conversation inshallah provides that so yeah, it's definitely an honor, definitely a privilege",
      "to you also for just making it happen. Yeah, like I said, I mean, yeah, I owe a lot of gratitude to Moise who sort of was instrumental in putting this together. But yeah, like i said, not only is he one of the giants of our American Muslim community but also, I think he represents a style of leadership, someone on the national stage pre-internet sensation,",
      "respected as a scholar, as a thought leader, as the leader in our community without all of the fanfare. You know, without all the fan fare, you know this was before the age of social media, this is before the ages of I think a lot of the sort of celebrity preacher culture that we've talked about on the show but it's become emblematic in the Muslim community so again it's just a real honor to be able to sit with Dr. Siddiqui",
      "Just a quick bio about Dr. Siddiqui, I mean, Dr. Mazamal Siddique was born in India in 1943, received his Islamic education at Darul Ulum Nazwatul Ulema, which is in Lucknow, India. He graduated from the Islamic University of Medina in Saudi Arabia in 1965 with a higher degree in Arabic and Islamic studies. And then he received his MA in Theology from Birmingham University in England",
      "University. Dr. Siddiqui has worked with several Islamic organizations in Switzerland, England and the United States. He has served as leadership among various Muslim organizations and centers. He's served two terms as president of ISNA, Islamic Society of North America. And since 1981 he has served right here where we're sitting today which is the director of the Islamic Society",
      "Assalamu alaikum Dr. Siddiqui, welcome to the Diffuse Congruence podcast. Waalaikumsalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. Thank you very much for coming.",
      "Capture the stories of, mashallah, the leaders whose shoulders we stand on today as a community. And you're certainly one of those and one of the pioneers of our community, mashalah. So we are very honored. We're sitting here in your beautiful office in Orange County. So that's even better to be in your home, as it were, or a place that you've called home for, what, 20 plus years now, mashAllah? Even longer. More than 40 years.",
      "in 40 years. And just echoing that, it's definitely an honor and a pleasure to be here. And as I get older, I think we realize how difficult it is just to raise children and balance just living in America with helping out the community. So, we appreciate it more and more as we get older and you know, raise families ourselves and get entrenched with just the busyness of life. So yeah,",
      "but also the time today. I thank Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and all of this is by His bounty. Mashallah. And we have a lot to cover with you, and I want to be mindful of your time as well. So, as we mentioned in the biography, you know, you were born in 1943 in Rampur, India. I think there's something sort of special about Rampor. I've heard you on other occasion or I read somewhere that the name Rampore itself was another name for the town",
      "name for the town originally and it changed i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about those sort of early experiences you had um rampur being of course a town in uttar pradesh uh ramport is about 120 miles east northeast of delhi um yes i mean its population has now grown to almost 400 000 people but at the time when i was born what 100 000 people",
      "So from Indian standards, it's a small town. It's a city but it has history. It was a princely state during the British time and then after the independence of India, it was merged with the Indian Union. Its rulers were Muslims",
      "So it is a city of Islamic culture and Islamic literature also. In the Urdu language, people talk about Lucknow, Delhi, and they talk about Rampur. So famous for its poetry, for its literary work, great poets. The Nawabs of Rampura were great patrons of learning as well as for an established very good library.",
      "and during the time of the first Nawab of Rampur, Faizullah Khan they established a library purchased lot of manuscripts from all over in Arabic Persian Urdu and other languages so it has more than 12,000 rare manuscripts actually Wow! And so it's known as Raza Library",
      "a library and it is now in one of the palaces of Nawab Hamid Manzil and lot of people come from all over to visit the library. It has beautiful Jamaat-e-Astead, it has other schools but when I was growing up at that time Jamaat Islami of India moved its headquarters",
      "quarters, Rampur. So many leaders of Jamaat Islami came and they were visiting the city also so we had some of the prominent leaders scholars who are there and they established an Islamic school primary school which is called Dar Sighah Islami and it was a boarding school for boys",
      "And so I was in the boarding school, although it was not too far from my home. It's only about 20 minutes walk from my room but my parent wanted me to be in their boarding school more in this Islamic environment and tarbiyah and all of these things. They were very concerned about that. My father joined Jamaat Islami",
      "with the influence of his friend, Maulana Muhammad Abdul Hayy who became later my father-in-law also. So Maulani Muhammad Abdulhayy and my father were very close to each other. Maulano Muhammad AbdulHayy was the founder of Maktab al-Hasanat and he used to publish many magazines Al Hasanat, Noor, Hadi, Ujala and other publications. He was a great",
      "a great writer, prolific writer. So he's the one who influenced my father to read the books of Maulana Madhudi and join Jamaat-e-Islami. So I grew up in that kind of environment which is very religious environment. My father was a government employee civil servant and he had a very good position but",
      "found that his job would not allow him to offer his prayers on time. So he left that and he was looking for other kind of works in business. Alhamdulillah, he did quite well after that as well. And I have... We had nine siblings including myself. Big family Mashallah. We were five boys and four girls.",
      "My two sisters passed away. The eldest one was married to Maulana Muhammad Yusuf Islahi, and the youngest one was not well so she passed away So we are now seven I'm the eldest son We have four other brothers and three sisters now Two sisters actually yeah now so Alhamdulillah it's a good family",
      "good family. My parents were very concerned about our Islamic upbringing and he wanted very much that I study Islam and become a scholar and an Islamic person with Islamic education. You know, that's very interesting because the two things you mentioned",
      "are things that we think about today for our kids. You know, being able to pray at work also making sure that our children are raised as Muslims I think maybe some of us take for granted that in Muslim countries it was just automatic but it sounds like we actually had families and parents fathers and mothers had to make effort even back then to pass on Islam to their kids It's a reminder, it didn't just come easy",
      "tension and an effort even back then. I'd love to hear about just life as what the Muslim environment was like back then, and even your description of living with minorities in India. That's something that sounds very interesting to learn more about as well. Or living as a minority in India because you know... May Allah bless them. They were very observant of their religion. Go to masjid regularly for prayers and make sure that we pray.",
      "my mother she one time he told me that if you pray 40 prayers in the masjid with jamaah and first takbir i will give you some price so this was like 40 days I continued doing that and then got used to it and also reading quran every day",
      "of hearing the recitation of the Quran. So may Allah bless them and give them the place, give them honor in the Jannah inshaAllah. InshaAllah, I mean so you mentioned one of the things I was curious about obviously this is pre-partition India. In your early childhood what were some of the interactions with people of other faith communities",
      "When partition happened, you know what were those? You know how is that? Rampur had large Muslim population although they are also many Hindus and We were very it was peaceful city the relationship between Muslims and Hindus They were not a people of other faiths and some Sikh. Of course, right they came from Punjab area settled in that area so",
      "relationship was very good and my father was well respected by Hindus also. And we had some good neighbors from the Hindu community so the relationship was almost like you know people of same town, same thing. So we never had any problem with the Hindu",
      "was born in 1943 and 1948 you have the establishment of Pakistan independence of India division of India right so there were some Commotions demonstrations You see that and then we used to hear a lot of riots taking place in the city called Baradabad Which is only 17 miles from Rampur and in Bareilly also, so those circles by cities had problems",
      "cities had problems but somehow with the blessing of Allah SWT, the city of Rampur remained peaceful. One of my mother's uncle was Maulana Muhammad Ali Jawahar and Shawkat Ali so Maulano Muhammad Ali and Shawkati these are the people who were known as independence leaders",
      "were involved in the independence struggle of India. He went to the Round Table Conference, to London and there he made a saying that if you want to go back with independent India otherwise you have to give me a place for my grave here. He died there but his grave was in Jerusalem so he's buried",
      "When I visited Mr. Laksa, he visited his grave and prayed for him. So we were very proud of that, that he was involved and he was a great writer in English, published magazines and is a poet as well. Muhammad Ali Jauro's influence is there. Yeah, and then you mentioned, of course, who would become your brother-in-law or Moulana Yousafzai",
      "Maulana Yusuf Islahi, Rahimullah who passed away in 2021 just last year we lost him. He was your sister's brother I mean excuse me sister's husband? Yeah my elder sister's Husband Okay and so you ended up after I think primary school You went to the school that he was at or he was right where he what was the relationship?",
      "So, I finished my primary school in Rampur Darsgah. We were thinking to go to some school and Maulana Islahi was just married to my sister so he suggested that I go to Madrasa Salislaah being the brother-in-law recently married of course my parents listened to me much more so he is the one who accompanied",
      "me okay to sir I'm here Adam girl I was there and then admitted and of course the teachers at the end they recognized my analysis like he very much and respected him so I was admitted and well treated because being the brother of an unusual sign but unfortunately after a few months",
      "flu epidemic. So a lot of people got, the students got sick and the teachers got sick, and I got sick. And that was difficult. Yeah, I think this is the 1958-57, 58-59 flu I've heard about. Correct? Yes. In India, yeah. Good memory. This thing, I was already homesick. Now, physically more homesick when I'm sick. Right. And you're just a teenager as well, correct?",
      "Yeah, so I then my parents called me and said to come back. I went back So I spent about three months in mother's solace law in try me awesome I don't claim any that I Got much from there But I met well enough for us and it's like the great scholar of Quran and other scholars I remember I used to go in the afternoon",
      "to go in the afternoon to Maulana Akhtar's Bangla and some students used to gather after Asr there. And Maulanan Akhter used to make very good tea, so I remember drinking some tea with him and learning but at that time of course was very young. He is one of the prominent students of Maulanah Hamizuddin Farahi",
      "manuscripts of Maulana Ahmed Hussain's writings. So he and Amin As-San Islahi were classmates. Okay. Yeah. MashaAllah. So, you know, I mentioned, of course, I knew the connection but Maulano Yusuf Islahy, I have a distinct memory when I was 12 years old we were visiting India. We're from Hyderabad. And my uncle who was very interested in my",
      "very interested in my, you know, tarbiyah and my like making sure that I had the resources that I need. Took me to a bookstore and just bought me just any book he could find off the bookshelf. I think that he wanted me to or wanted to ensure that I read. And so in that collection there was obviously plenty of books by Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi Rahim Allah who of course we'll talk about him very soon but as far as fiqh",
      "He bought me everyday fiqh, which was the English translation of Maulana Yusuf Islahi's Ahsan Fiqh. Ahsan fiqhh, yes. Yeah, mashallah. So definitely connected to him from a very early childhood and at that time not even knowing Hanafi versus Maliki or whatever but the jurisprudence that I learned besides observing my parents was you know from everyday fiqi mashaAllah so very indebted to him and then years later I would meet him in Houston he came",
      "at the masjid. This would have been in the 90s, so he was, yeah, so we lost a tremendous amount. His book, San Fiqh, became very popular and it's still very popular. Yeah, I guess that was my point. The interesting thing is that this book was translated into English by, I don't remember the name, but someone in Pakistan and it was published without his name",
      "without his name, the translator's name was there but not Maulana Yusuf Slythe. And when Maulano came for time to America I told him about that so he was shocked. The book is published by somebody else's name not his name. So he worked on that and he asked me",
      "I reviewed the translation and then after that it was published in his name. Alhamdulillah.",
      "Muhammad As-Sulahi would become such a part of my vernacular. The edition that came after 1978, I think they have. Okay, so I don't know how old I look to you but yeah this would have been the 1980s. But yeah my point of mentioning that was just of course just again the connection but also everyday fiqh and everyday fiqi was such a... That was like the book that you would give a young child or",
      "wanting to learn the rights of the five pillars of Islam, you know? So mashallah. So now after you finish your even let's say high school level education is this where you go to...you consider your options and you transition to Nadwatul Ulama? Yeah, after I came back from Madrasat al-Islah of Sulaimir",
      "course recovering from the sickness and then so I spent almost a year-and-a-half in Rampur and at that time I did kind of went from one teacher to another learning Arabic and then also taking few exams in Urdu literature and Persian",
      "I went to Aligarh to take the high school exam they used to have an external exam for the external students so I had a high school certificate and so after taking all these certificates of Urdu literature and Persian literature",
      "I had a teacher in Rampur. His name was Maulana Jalil Ahsan Ndawi He has a famous book called Rahi Amal collection of Hadiths So I used to go to him every day to learn Arabic study Hadith and Quran And he suggested that I should go to Nadwa and pursue my further studies in Nadwa, and he told me that go and attach yourself to Abul Hasan",
      "Abul Hasan, our son in-law. So that's I became interested to go so I told my parent and my father and Maulana Yusuf Islai, my brother-in-law and we all went to Lucknow. In Lucknow I had my grandfather, my mother's father",
      "And then we all went together. There was one of my uncles, Sheikh Mushtansurullah, he was a prominent leader of Lucknow. He was also there. So we get like whole delegation, five six people. We went there to Nadoa and Maulana Abu Al-Hussein, he was very happy",
      "have breakfast with him so he has a big fuss and he said that oh that's very nice they'll have somebody from such a prominent family coming here to do it so I was tested which class I should go you know not do I had several program one is the primary education",
      "and then two years for Fadil, and after that research students for Fatwa and other things. So I was tested because of my knowledge of Arabic and Islamic studies. I was admitted to the fifth class. Instead of spending seven years in the Alim program, I started with a fifth year. And so I spent about three years in Nadua.",
      "Okay, because it was like a placement exam based on which exam. Yeah, so that's the exam and I passed the test very well throughout. I mean I was one of the very good students there actually I received next year following here I received some scholarship from NADUA, a small amount which was almost like 100 rupees. It was a good thing to have that like every get",
      "is 9.8 rupees every month. Stipend, yeah. That's amazing. Now at that time I imagine it wasn't much but 9-10 rupees bought you more than the purchasing power. Nice. So I studied there Hadith, Quran, Fiqh and Arabic language.",
      "interested to pursue Arabic studies and the Maulana Abbas Ali Nadwi's nephew, Maulano Muhammad Rabi Nadwi. May Allah bless him keep him in good health. Maulono Rabi was one of the teachers of Arabic literature okay and he was I was",
      "have some special classes with you to study some books in Arabic he was very gracious he accepted that and he says well the only time is that you have to come to my masjid in the evening and after the maghrib prayer I can give you some time so I used",
      "and then go to Covent Road where the masjid was, and go and pray Maghrib there. And after Maghriib he would pray his Nawafil so I have to wait and do my homework at that time. Then after that he will give me like half an hour. So I read several books in Arabic with him. Not only that but he used to ask me whatever I read",
      "Diary a summary of that and so this helped me to To write Arabic to compose our big I became quite good in composition of Arabic So it was reading out of a understanding out of the composition of other week, and not they speak not spoken Arabic We did not do there right but I was It helped you a lot. I thank him my love bless him and that is My knowledge of Arabic really",
      "of Arabic really I go back to him. Maulana Rabi Nadeem after the death of Maulano Abdullahi became the head of Nadwa and he is still heading Nadwa okay and he's a leader of Muslim personal board in India so yeah that's how we spent the time in Nadwa. So interestingly you're not",
      "a alumni, if you will or a graduate from Nadwa. We had Dr. Ibrahim Musa on the show in the past and so he spoke a little bit about this but it was from your perspective and I would love for your insight as far as I understand, you know, the Muslim intellectual history or Muslim intellectual tradition in India has various streams, if",
      "Then the Darul Ulum, Deoband. And so I was wondering where Ferengi Mahal ties into that? I don't know. I wonder if these are all tributaries that come from Ferenghi Mahal but regardless you have various strains. You also mentioned Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. So if you could maybe comment on kind of placing for our listeners these various streams and what may be some of the subtle nuances.",
      "almost it becomes like a negative but the differences if you will or the subtle nuances between these two, these various streams that were prominent in India at the time. The unique characteristics if you oh there you go.",
      "And very good, they used to emphasize that. And hadiths there was also close by a school called Madahirul Uloom in Saharanpur and then Aligarh University of course was more for secular education so Sayyid Ahmad Khan is the one who founded the Anglo-Mohammadan College. Right, that's what it was called.",
      "then after that it became university so this was for english education secular education science and all those things although they had islamic studies program as well uh so maulana muhammad ali mungeri and malala shibli nomani and others they are the one who thought that we should have an institution",
      "at secular education and it should be open not only to Hanafis but Hanafi, Shafi'im, Alika all the schools. It will bring closeness to all these school and people of Ahl al-Hadith persuasion. That's where Nadwa was established so Nadwa is more open. It was not restricted to one school of fiqh",
      "as well and then also there were some education of English. Of course the founders wanted it to have English science and other things but it did not have that, it remained with Islamic studies only. But it was open to all other schools and students came from all over India and other places as well. They had number of students from South Africa",
      "who were there. And Nadwa is still, Nadwa has now grown a lot. We used to have few hundred students at that time when I was there but now it has more than 8000 students at Nadwa. It's almost like a university. And so, I've always been curious about this the name Nadwi is that like a title or is that a family name? No, no, it's title. That's what I thought. It' s like people from Aligarh called Alig",
      "And people around Madrasul Islah called Islaahi. So this is not family name, but there was a group called Nadwa. Nadwa means gathering. Council. So it's Nadwat Al-Ulema, a council of scholars and the council of the scholars established Dar al-Uloom. The name of their school is Dar al Uloom",
      "That is the full name of Ndewa. And they were great scholars there, Sulaiman Ndwi was there and then other people. So Maulana Abul Hasan Lee Ndawi, Masood Alam Ndavi was his classmate, Maulanan Masood alam, Maulan Muhammad Nazim Ndowi in Pakistan. These are the people who were",
      "who graduated from Najwa and he was there when I went there. So, I had the fortune to be close to him and I used to go from my home where I was staying in my grandfather's home, I used almost two or three times a week on my bike in the evening as well so I used",
      "between Asr and Maghrib there. He used to have a, he used to a Majlis where people would come in to visit him, and also students would comes from upper classes. So I used to attend that and sit down and listen to questions and answers and his talks.",
      "And then you're spending time. And then, you know, it was nice time to have drink cup of tea with him. That's what I mean, right? Yeah.",
      "You said you mentioned your other teacher. It became very personal. Yeah, right, right. That's fascinating. They used to call me like son. I remember that one time I was there in Delhi and his Marana Abbasani was there. So he said to my father, he is like a son to me. And you remember that? That means it was impactful.",
      "Because you remember him saying that. That means it meant something to you at a young age. It must have been extraordinary. So what happens after, again just for the sake of time there's a lot to cover but I want to hit at least the highlights. After Natawatul Alama your studies they continue for quite some time so I'm wondering if you could take us through that journey a little bit. And I was in the last year of Alim",
      "lodging, travels. They provide tickets to go from your country to Medina. So I was excited when they heard that this news and wanted very much to be there. So, I mentioned to Maulana Hulusi and he wrote that. I asked him to write me a letter of recommendation. He was very gracious. He wrote a very nice letter. I wish I had kept it. I know. I was just about to ask you if you have a copy of that.",
      "So I received that letter and the university was admitting students from India also. And NADWA recommended few students, but my name was not there among them. So what I did? I very quietly took the letter of Madanapuram Sandhya and went direct to Delhi.",
      "and asked him to take me to the embassy. So he went, he took me to an embassy and I said I want to meet the ambassador so it was fortunate that he... I said, I'm coming from Olanabursundi and his letter so he allowed me to go and meet the Ambassador",
      "Yusuf Fauzan was the ambassador at that time so he received me very nicely and actually he had visited Nadua just about year before and he visited our class and at that when he visited the class I was reading something from the Hadith because you used to read the book and then after this",
      "was very good in reading Arabic so he heard me and he was kind of impressed that I read with correct pronunciation and correct vocalization of letters and all those things so he recognized me okay well then you read the letter and then he said okay go back to",
      "send telegram to the to Medina to this language no see and let you know what answers so I came back I did not tell anybody in another that I went there also one day I was in the class in Ottawa and somebody came said the principal's want you to come",
      "what did I do so I went there and I saw a smile on his face they said wow you have been accepted in Madina's language congratulations and but he said that they are saying that you have to be there next week Wow yeah and I was getting ready for the exam final",
      "so I said what about my exam so Malana Irfan was the principal at that time in Labrador he said you can go and then when you come in summer take the exam so we'll give you a special exam",
      "relief because I was thinking if I don't go next week probably I'll not be a clip so I was afraid to lose that so he said all right and then spoke also tomorrow person and he agreed to sir alright could we smithina you don't want",
      "him and he was excited very happy then after that I went to Rampur of course those days is not easy to communicate on telephone no cell phone just took the ticket and when they arrived my mother was surprised how come you're there as I told her this what happened father",
      "the muster praying Isha when he came to him and he was very happy so alhamdulillah then this I told you I have only two days I had to return to go to Delhi he woke up my uncle said we have",
      "He opened the shop during the night, purchased some fabric. And we went to our family Darzi. I love it. And he was excited. Oh, mashallah, you are going to Medina. So I'm going to work all night to prepare clothes. Beautiful. Yeah. So in two days, we were ready. You had outfits made and everything. Mashallah.",
      "MashaAllah. So you left in two days. Your father-in-law? Yeah, I was engaged to his daughter, Fadila and our engagement continued for almost eight years. How old were you at this time? At the time of the acceptance into the University of Medina? No before that when I was in Nadua.",
      "Sorry, how old were you when you... When I was engaged? I think 19 years. He said he was engaged for eight years because then he went overseas. And my khalda was only about 13. So she did not do anything about all this thing. Just like arranged things. That's right. Alhamdulillah. Your fathers were friends. But we knew the family. Families knew each other because they're living not too far. Only about 10 minutes walk or 15 minutes walk from there.",
      "You mentioned that your fathers were good friends. Yes. Was the journey to Medina by air or by sea? I know we recently had some conversations about how people would of course take boats. No, we went by air. But there was no direct flight from Delhi to Medinah. Actually, there's no direct fly from Delhi",
      "and then after that from Bombay we went to Dharan. This is myself and few other students from Nadua, all together so it's a group of five students. So you're sitting across two people who both have Dharon connections? My family my father worked for Aramco and his father taught at UPM. He came from a university? No of course he knows UPM yeah. We spent",
      "yeah until our flight was there because they were only one or two flights from daran to medina so we had to wait for that and uh so we stayed in the hotel that was paid by the airline and then we went to medin after that and this was there was somebody from the university at the airport to receive us",
      "We were given the accommodation in a hotel in Medina, that was the only hotel, one or two hotels at that time in Medin. So we spent a few days in Medinas. The hospitality of the university was for three days and then... And after that you had to find your own place? Then after three days they... I mean we went next day to University",
      "and got the admission. There was also a placement test, and some students went to the Sanavi, to the secondary school, and somewhere to Alia, the higher. So I was admitted to higher, and that was a four-year program. And the university had a hostel, and this was an army barracks.",
      "And there was, so they gave us a room there. Few students from NADWA were together and give us our furniture. So we had to go to those storage collectable bed and beddings and all those things and then brought them to our room. Of course we used to cook our own food and clean our rooms and wash our clothes,",
      "All of these things were there and then the classes are simple. Desks and benches rather, benches and thing and there was no air conditioning. Actually electricity was not there only a few hours at night we used to get electricity. Was this all of Medina was like this or just the university because it's brand new? This was 62, 62 is the first bed.",
      "So it's brand new. The whole university concept is brand new there. Not concept, but they belong to the university. So they were probably figuring things out as well, right? No, that's why I ask. Was it just a school where all of Medina was like this with limited electricity, etc.? So this was the facilities. 1962, you were the first batch at Medina. Yes, I was in Medina and this was a small university at the time. It was just the beginning, the first year of university.",
      "And the total number of students were about 250. So we moved to university and they used to give us a monthly allowance for earlier students was 300 real, which is good amount of money at that time. Yeah. So it was for our food.",
      "For our food and other expenses. And for Sanaviya, it was 250 riyal. So they gave us first allowance and we had no money at the time. Young students. And actually you probably had not traveled outside of India. This is the first time so you're meeting students from all around the world, correct? Yes, that's right. It was the first",
      "taking a plane. Yeah, and Medina was quite underdeveloped at the time or not it was not like it was today obviously. At that time the total population of Medina were about 50,000 people. Wow! And at the Haram not too many people except at Hajj time. Okay. So we had our classes from morning till Zohar time then you have lunch and take some rest",
      "And then after us the buses used to go from The University you're still about four miles From the harem Then we go to harem muster than Nabi Salah and we arrived there and then Go to haram, and that's where we spent the time from Maghrib from Asad to Tisha Wow And sometime he used to have a",
      "During the ordinary days there was not much crowd so I would go inside and sit next to the grave of the Prophet and read the Quran and do my homework. Or sometime at Sufah, in that place where the students used to sit.",
      "I used to do. And then sometimes you sit in the courtyard of Haram with all other students and talk, and sit down and meet other people. The Baqi was on the other side, you could just walk over to the baqi. Yes, yes. And of course in Medina there were people from all over the world. Right. So meet them learn about the lahajat of the Arabic different dialects of other people from different countries. Because you're encountering like Omar mentioned",
      "mentioned you're encountering people for the first time not only outside of India but even, obviously within the Arab world you're in countering like you said different. Still probably mostly Arab world and South Asia right? Probably not now of course you have people from the West and Far East and so forth and Europe even but back then it was did were there any... Did you ever come across anybody",
      "Middle East and South Asia? Yeah, I don't think I met anybody from America or Europe. Mostly people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and then also from Arab countries. I remember one time after Maghrib, I was praying in the courtyards of the harem, and somebody passed by and something he whispered in my ear. Even though I was",
      "So I was praying, but he whispered into my ear. And then after that when I finished my prayer, I saw this person had spread his own musalla and was praying. So I thought that he needed something. He needed some help. So took some rials from my pocket and put them under his musalla.",
      "travelers and he needed some help so I gave him and He came and he told me. I don't need money. I have a lot of money I don' t need any money, I just said to you to pray for me Then we became good friends Okay, I was gonna say that the fact that you remember this instance incident But of course then you became friends like you said um so at that time were there any",
      "I guess teachers that you would want to mention who were at Medina at this time? The actual teachers. The teachers were some of the very prominent people from the Muslim world. Of course, Sheikh Bin Baz, he was the vice-chancellor. I thought so. Muhammad ibn al-Ibrahim, the mufti of Saudi Arabia, was the chancellor and his assistant was Sheikh Bin Bad. Sheikh Bin Bal was the Vice Chancellor but at the same time he was also a teacher. Okay, so you took classes with him.",
      "You took classes with the best. He used to teach us Aqidah, you know? And we had Sheikh Amin Shonquiti, a great scholar of Tafsir. That's right. His famous Tafseer, Adwaa al-Bayan. He was our Tafser teacher and we had Nasruddin Albani, Hadith scholar, famous for it. Of course, of course. So he used to teaches Hadith. Amazing.",
      "Amazing. Especially Subulus Salaam, I studied with him. We had Sheikh Abdul Mohsen Abad for Hadith. It was, I mean, for Fiqh. So we studied humbly Fiqah and also Usul al-Fiqh, humbly Usul Al-FiQH. And then also a scholar for Arabic literature, Adab al-Arabi.",
      "And that was Sheikh Abdul Qadir Shaykh Abdul Hamd. May Allah bless him. So, and later came from Pakistan Moulana Nazim Nadevi. And Moulan Nazim is one of the classmates of Moulin Abu Rasaleh Nadewi but he was teaching in Pakistan",
      "he was brought to teach at Medina, to come to Medin and teach there. So he was teaching Islamic Ethics and when he came I...he came by himself without his family so",
      "I went to meet him and then also, I moved with him. And my brother was also there because he was by himself. He needed some help for that so we used to be there and help him. So after that he became the father-in-law of my younger brother. Who is this? Sorry? My younger brother Mudassir Siddiqui. Of course who's a lawyer.",
      "He's a lawyer. Yeah, I've met him once. He married Muala Nazim's daughter. Oh, mashallah! Okay, I did not know that connection. There are a lot of connections established. That's right. Mualana Nazim......daughter was married to Dr. Zafarish Haaf Ansari. And you... That name should mean something to you. I'm gonna have to go do a check later with my parents.",
      "Is best friends with your sister? From the who taught in was from Malaysia. Yeah, that's right Yes, yes, yes doctor the police help cause married to my daughter Other daughter and you're and his other daughter was married to your brother. He is married to you, brother Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes, it's not consignee. Yeah His daughter is best friends of my sister Oh from from the Haran days",
      "I mentioned. Was he at UPM? They were there, they were there in UPM somehow. And their father Maulana Zafar Ahmad Ansari who came to Medina and met him and then after that I spent some time with him in Geneva at the Islamic Center of Geneva. So we have a lot to cover and I don't know how we're gonna yeah so I want to also start being again I'm going to be mindful of the time and reach some sort of",
      "of ending point. I have a question that I've been burning to ask about Medina at that time when Medina was started and, of course you had the blessings of all Libra teachers in India, was there like an idea... how am i trying? I want to say this gently but I guess the ideology or the sort of the Aqidah",
      "Was there a very, you know, sort of prominent if you will Salafi or Wahabi ideological bent? Or was it pretty much straight Hanbali and say Athari or something Aqidah. Was it like that at that time? At that time it was university was like international university. It did not have only Hanbalis.",
      "Salafi and Wahabi thinking was there, but it was not pushed to students. We did not feel any pressure that you become Salafis. Salafist students were given preference. They were given better treatment.",
      "But we did not feel discrimination. We did not fear the pressure upon us. Nobody said to me that become a Salafi. Yeah. So, well, that's great. So then after Medina where do you go? Where does your continuing education take you? Yeah four years of Medina passed very fast. It was a beautiful time. Would you on holidays you would be able to go back? I used to go home",
      "I used to go home, sometimes to India and also one year myself and my brother with this we visited Middle Eastern countries. We went to Jordan spent some time there and then after that to Lebanon and Syria and then After that we went by ship to Alexandria And you spend some time in Egypt. So we traveled in these countries",
      "countries. You and your brother? Me and my brother, yeah. Any... Met some of the prominent scholars there. Yeah I'd be curious just kind of what you're at a very high level given the time what your observations about those countries were because i believe um there was probably a lot of opportunity to spend time with Chuyu and traditional and uh traditional scholars and so forth and at the same time i think those countries are becoming more and more secular right if i'm not mistaken mistaken is that right? Yeah but there was some stability there",
      "stability there. In Jordan it was 1964 so I was able to go to Jerusalem and all this west coast area, so we spent time in Jericho, in Jerusalem, Annapolis, Sultram, all these cities of and in Jerusalem we spend some time Alhamdulillah",
      "Alhamdulillah. And of course in Amman, so we traveled all over in Jordan it was easy. Okay, less politicized I'm sure. Then after that and then we took we went by car to all these places okay from Jordan we came from Medina to Jordan we come by plane and then",
      "I was also a lot Hama and Halab and other places and met some scholars Sheikh of Ghudda was the Hadith scholar, I met him and other people so and then Muhammad al Mubarak Mustafa Al Sibai",
      "and spent some time in Beirut, and traveled to the hills of Lebanon. And then we went to Egypt. Okay. Yeah. So in terms of your studies though, after Medina you go to Birmingham? Or am I missing something? After Medina I went to Geneva. Geneva. Oh yeah that's right. That's another big step because you're moving further and further away from India. In Medina when I was last year",
      "I was in the last year of my study, I met at one of the conferences that was organized by Muslim World League. Rabita actually was established in 1964 and I was there when it was established and Moulana Mahmood Moududi, Moulan Abbas Ali Nadwi, Sheikh Mahmoud Sawaf and other people, some people they came",
      "And I helped as a student of the university. I helped in the conference. So, Maulana Apollos Nadi for example he dictated to me some of his lectures and I just took notes and prepared for him. Just jealous in the nicest way. And then I met Saeed Ramadan there. I was going to just about to ask you about it. Saeed Ramadhan was one of the organizers of the conference there.",
      "Was he in Switzerland at the time? He was living in Switzerland. He was leaving his hotel. Yeah, this is our Ramadan's father for the head of the Islamic Center of Geneva and Hassan al-Banna's Son-in-law right yeah, so I I also helped him Do some some secretarial work for him some taking from notes and writing things and nothing",
      "So, and I loved his Al-Muslimun the paper that he used magazine that he was to publish. I used to subscribe to it and then actually promoted Al-muslimun among the students in Medina so he received me very nicely and then he said when are you going to finish your studies in medina?",
      "I'm going to finish. He said, would you like to come to Geneva? To help us at the Islamic Center? Oh, it's obviously nice to do that because the university were asking me to go after finishing my studies to Africa to teach at some of their schools. Islamic schools. Which part of Africa were they asking you to go to? Rhodesia. I don't know where that is. Where is that? They used to send to different cities.",
      "to different countries Ghana Uganda I think it's West Africa different places they have to send so they were asking me also to go there but I did not say anything but when I got this invitation from Siddh Ramadhan although it was nothing formal he simply just said that I was not sure whether he will really accept",
      "almost towards the end of my study that medina i sent you a letter that I'll be ready next month and you said to me that you want somebody to help at the Islamic center so if you like please let me know so he's he said yes you are very welcome and i will send you the ticket",
      "So I received the ticket to fly from Jeddah to Geneva via Beirut. Of course, I spent a day or two in Beiru and then after that went to Geneva. When I arrived in Geneva there was nobody at the airport. And I had no friends and it's my first time coming to Europe",
      "So I the only thing I knew from the address of the mic up almost limon carnivore A card number is a railway station. That's all you know, I thought carnaval maybe this the place where they sent it so I When I didn't see anybody I took a taxi and take told the text is kind of Or maybe assured him because I could not do you say God now my cardamom",
      "So he took me and dropped me at the railway station. What to do? I went to a telephone booth, but I had no coins. And I didn't even know how to use the coin phone. So I asked somebody passing by, he said that I have to use",
      "and put the number. So, telephone rang at the Islamic Center. People said, we are waiting for you. Where are you? Give me an address. Then they came. It was not too far from the Islamic center to Karnava station. Only 10-20 minutes walk. So they came and then they took me to the center. When I arrived at the",
      "And I was at the Islamic Center in Metmolana, Zafar Ahmad Ansari. His brother, yeah? His father. Father, sorry. Yeah, and he was very gracious, very nice. Actually, they were starting a class in French. So he told me that we are going to start a class, you want to join? So after arrival, two hours after that, I was in the class to study French. Were you able to stay? Continue, yeah.",
      "continue yeah we'll continue with that Alhamdulillah myself and Maulana Zafar Ahmad Nasari were classmates and I guess",
      "Not too many, but like eight, 10 people can stay. And we had students from Turkey, from England, from Europe, from Japan. So we used to be together and taking lessons from various other scholars who used to visit. Maulana Hamidullah from Paris used to come visit us. Muhammad Hamidallah. Hamid Allah, yes, used to",
      "There was the Imam there at the center, Sheikh Buzuzu, Rahimallah. He was from Algeria. So he was and other Mawlana Zafar Ahmad Ansari and Sheikh Sayyid Ramadan himself. So it was a good meeting place. Did you meet Tariq Ramadan at this time? At this time. TariQ was very young. Must have been right. Yeah, he was probably four or five year old. But Dr. Sayyed Ramadan asked me to go",
      "me to go to who to teach his children okay he had I think four or five boys and one girl and they were all very young so eldest was a man the say was called Abu Ayman I am an Bilal thought honey and yes sir yeah",
      "So they all used to come and I did not know French to speak to them so I used to speak in Arabic, and then you very little Arabic. The children yeah. They spoke at home their Arabic so I use to tell them read help me to reach Quran and also tell them the stories from the Quran. So I remember Tariq he used to",
      "And he was only just that young, probably four or five years old. But his elder brothers Ayman and Bilal they were the ones. So many interesting stories! I'm sure we could spend hours and hours just diving into all the details and experiences but we'd love to in the interest of time fast forward a bit to your experience coming to America. There's so much to talk about obviously after you came here",
      "what was the initial spark for you to consider making that big change from Europe, of course, to the United States? Yes I was in Geneva and then from Geneva I went to England to do my studies at Birmingham University. I got admission at Birmingham",
      "finish MA. I got a degree of MA and after that, I wanted to do PhD. I was thinking of several universities in England. There was the possibility to go to Cambridge University but one of my professors at Birmingham University recommended",
      "here at Harvard and so he also wrote a nice letter of recommendation for me. And he mentioned that there is a center there, Center for the Study of Religions at the Harvard Divinity School and it has international group of students and very nice place. So I got interested in",
      "So he wrote a letter of recommendation for me, good letter. And after a few months I got approval from the Center for the Study of Religions at Harvard and Dr. Cantwell Smith was the director of that center. So he sent a very nice letter of welcome",
      "also give you accommodation at the center for the study of religion and provide some scholarship so it was very helpful i was very happy with that and when I got that letter um so I decided to go to India to see my parent and uh my parents decided that I should not go to America without getting married",
      "married okay in 68 December 68 and then we returned to Birmingham and my wife joined me after a few months and we came together to Harvard Cambridge Massachusetts and I was received at the center they were given an apartment",
      "It was nice to be in that kind of environment with other students from various other religions. So there were some Muslims there, Dr. Abdullah Ghazi who was there already before me and he's the one who came to the airport to receive me. Wow! And his family was living there and myself and a few other people. There was Mahmoud Ayub from Lebanon was there. Of course.",
      "I think he just passed away, right? He passed away. Allah bless him. Allah Bless Him. Yeah. And they were Hindu students. They were Buddhists, Jewish and of course Christians. So it's an academic environment with multi-faith. We used to have our regular meeting every week for dialogue discussion on various topics and living in the center together",
      "and I was admitted first as a special student at the Divinity School. Take any courses that you would like so, and so I took courses in comparative religion world religions courses there and Alhamdulillah lot of coursework which was intensive program",
      "And then also I wanted to know about the Muslim community in that area. So there was Harvard Islamic Society, a small Islamic society but it was there so I joined that. Dr. Habibul Haq Nadwi was the president of the Islamic society. He went after that to South Africa and became professor at Durban University.",
      "And then after that, when he was leaving, he was trying to be finishing his PhD there. So he said I want to hand over the Islamic Society to you. So I became the president of the Islamic society at Harvard, Harvard Islamic Society. And remained as president for several years. Locally they were the Islamic Center of New England in Quincy, Massachusetts. So the people of Quincy came and they welcomed me",
      "me and they invited me to come and visit the Islamic Center there for 20 miles from Cambridge Massachusetts I had no car I did not even know how to drive but somebody used to come in and take me so it was very nice brother Nuri he used to take us me",
      "only on Sunday. They did not have Friday prayer. So actually one person said when I recover, said to them that you should have Friday Prayer somebody said well Friday means gathering Juma, Juma is gathering so we are never going to be having a gathering just Friday. Interesting. It was interesting kind of thing to hear that. Was um...I guess obviously the community at that time very small I mean even in the 80s",
      "and so forth. Is that what it was like back then as well? Yeah, very few people used to come but a lot of people used",
      "The students were mostly at Harvard Islamic Center.",
      "on Sundays. Got it. Anybody in the academy at the time who was Muslim? On the faculty? Like, I mean again, I guess in religious studies or Islamic studies? We had visiting professors. Okay. Anyone worth mentioning that you visited? Dr. Kamali was Hisham Kamali? Not Hishham Kamali. He was from India. He is a professor and other people used to come. And doctor, you mentioned Abdullah Ghazi. That's another name",
      "fortunate meeting. Dr. Abdullah Ghazi was a student and he was like you, a student. He was from the International Islamic University in Islamabad right? No, he was from India originally, from Aligarh University. Oh okay. He went to Aliggarh and then after that yeah he was in England for some time and then he came to Harvard. My father is only I think",
      "he moved, he brought him and my mother came. He was here earlier for studies but they came in 67 so that I'm kind of thinking of your experience in parallel to my father's and of course he started having children. My older sister she was born in 69 so I presume it sounds you know you're married but is your family growing? Is the Boston area becoming quote unquote home at this point? Yeah we lived in Cambridge not live in Boston right Cambridge",
      "Cambridge but going to Quincy and meeting with the people in Boston. It's all this yeah, it's like yeah About 20 or so Muslim families who are in that area and we became all used to meet quite often Yeah at Harvard or at Quincy And So it was not just academic work that whether doing I was also involved in the community right especially after becoming president",
      "with the Harvard Islamic Society, Islamic Center of Quincy. And then I found that there was MSA. So MSA became known and I became part of that. Dr. Ahmed Saqr came. Masha'Allah. And he spoke at Quincy Islamic Center and after that I joined MSA",
      "about that because I know MSA begins in the late 60s at the University of Illinois is that correct? Yes it was in Gary Indiana. The headquarter was Gary Indiana okay which is nearby but Chicago they were in Chicago and some in those areas that annual meetings used to take place understood uh the meetings were about 100 people 200 people like a small group of people and that early pioneer group i i know it consists of like Dr Barzingi",
      "Dr. Barzinji, Dr. Ahmed Sucker. Yeah exactly so these mashallah again standing on the shoulders of giants so as a community we are. It was very nice to meet that people associated with MSA and MSA had a religious affairs committee okay uh so they asked me to join the religious affairs",
      "And this committee was basically involved in deciding about Ramadan and Eid, moon sighting because it was an important issue at that time. And answering questions of students about family life and halal and haram, halal meat, all this kind of thing. So I became a member of that committee.",
      "the chairperson of that committee. So this way I was involved with ISNA, I mean with MSA at that time. And so far listeners who may not know the MSA becomes is the precursor to ISNA because you can imagine a group of immigrant predominantly immigrants but also indigenous peoples who are here there were students mostly. MSA started as a student body after 20 years",
      "and there was MSA, and there Muslim Islamic Medical Association, Association of Muslim Social Scientists, Association Muslim Scientists and Engineers. So they were this association all of them came together and they said that we are no more students some of us are professors some of the working in various companies so we should not call ourselves an MSA but we should have a",
      "have a community. So they call themselves ISNA, Islamic Society of North America. The Islamic Society Of North America came into being in 1982 almost 20 years after that. You know it's interesting my brother we just heard the founding the origin story of ISNA by the way listeners. Yeah absolutely. I want to focus on that if that's where you're headed. Absolutely now after ISNA MSA and all",
      "USA and all other bodies, they became affiliates of ISNA. And ISNA become like an umbrella body organization. It has its conventions and all those things. Of course. We definitely want to come back to ISNA and we don't want to leave out MINA. I'm involved at academic level at Harvard doing my studies, doing the coursework and all of these things. Alhamdulillah, I spent almost five years also",
      "also at Harvard and doing all this coursework and getting ready for PhD. So then I decided the thesis topic because I was involved in interfaith kind of thing, involved with study of religions so that's why I chose a topic for the study of Islamic way of looking at other religions especially the work of Ibn Taymiyyah.",
      "So that's I chose the topic and work on it for several years What what led you to focus on? ibn Taymiyyah specifically, I'm curious I'm one of their admirers of his work. He is a great is a giant of course of Islamic history philosopher Theologian jurist for an officer Prolific writer he had more than 300",
      "than 300 works. That's right. And some of them are multi-volume works, and he is among these people, he is the one who has written extensively on Christianity. Okay. I don't think anybody has written so extensively on Christianity as Ibn Taymiyyah wrote. So I found that one of his books called Al Jawab As-Sahi', The Sound Reply, it is almost 1,600 pages in four volumes that he wrote that.",
      "that he wrote that and this was written almost towards the end of his life uh he died in 1328 so before the so the book refers to many of his writings and it is not only his whatever he read in the islamic literature but you also studied the bible several versions",
      "very well aware of Christian history. So he read Ibn B'tarikh's history and he knew various sects and groups among Christians, and his answer is... There is an answer that was also written. This is the answer to a letter, a letter that came from Paul of Antioch from Sidon, Lebanon.",
      "Paul of Antioch wrote a letter to his Muslim friends saying that Prophet Muhammad was the prophet for Arabs only he was not a prophet for Christians so Christians don't have to follow him and then also I mentioned that Quran praises Jesus and Mary and the Christian people so that means Christians they are in",
      "right way there's nothing wrong with that and then for that it explains in his theology okay theology of christianity right so even at amia um i mean this letter was written about 100 years before even time yeah oh but uh it was circulating in the middle east a lot of people were receiving this guy this letter and was in the community was it also",
      "Probably, that might have been the purpose. But it was a... The environment was tense because of the invasion of the Mongols and all of these things. So in that kind of tense atmosphere this letter came and it was Shahabuddin Qarafi also received this letter and he wrote a very strong vehement answer. Really?",
      "Al-Fakhira ala as'ilat al-fajra",
      "in his answer. But it's very strong. Okay. It's very",
      "quest then from me, from the show. Please anything we can do, anything anyone you know because I think that's a very important piece. You would agree. I mean especially in this environment where I think Muslims are living in America especially in a Christian majority Muslim minority situation. There was a Catholic scholar who also did PhD in Chicago under Professor Fadl Rahman on the same book, on the",
      "I felt that uh no, no i'm sure we will still benefit from your Thomas. Michelle thomas mitchell okay michelle thank you No so I so I was in that environment and at harvard and of course I did not isolate myself just to academic right but involved with the community as well Yeah, and not only community in massachusetts in uh at cambridge But also on the national level right with the MSA",
      "Right, with the MSA. And traveling to different places and all those things. So I mean that's how it is. Well I definitely want to hear some of those experiences. I think you mentioned ISNA was formed in 1982? No no no no. That's what I thought I heard. ISNA sorry MSA okay yeah. So i wanna hear a little just about the 1970s experience because just as our preparation Pervez was um Pervez and I were talking about how there was a Hajj group",
      "MashaAllah, you are so well-learned and from so many different parts of the Muslim world. Diversity. There's a diversity there. A diverse, eclectic academic career. Was there an end goal in mind when you started? Or was it just the pursuit of knowledge and one thing led to another and your interests grew and expanded?",
      "at the Center for the Study of Religion under the leadership, Cantwell Smith. I did not find any antagonism, any kind of polemics. There was dialogue but not polemic. So I was not in a polemical kind of atmosphere and not anti-Islam or anti-Christian something like that this was not the point right so we were studying learning about other",
      "about other religions and having a kind of peaceful atmosphere. So I was in that kind of atmosphere, and there was encouragement of learning. Many great scholars there, giants of world history, world religions as well as Christian studies. So i took courses on Christianity and Christian history, the ethics study of New Testament and Old Testament",
      "I learned some Greek and some Hebrew, Aramaic. So I wanted to study that. And then so with this kind of background study, I was very much involved with the study and then family life and then community life. It was a busy time. Of course.",
      "even Nadwatullah, was there always an end goal in mind? You had the intention to becoming a professor or academia or imam. That was my primary goal, to go into academic life and continue teaching and studying and doing research. Understand. That's what I was doing. And so continued for work for almost five years, six years at Harvard",
      "at Harvard. I had children, my daughter was born there and then after that I had my sons, I have three sons, four sons, so three sons and one daughter. Your daughter is the oldest and she was born in Cambridge? Yeah Alhamdulillah.",
      "Around 1976, Muslim World League opened an office in New York and Dr. Amir Saqer was chosen to be the director of that office. So Dr. Saqar persuaded me",
      "Come and help establishment of that office in New York at the United Nation But when he is such a persuasive person Such a convincing process. Oh after Several meetings and calls and after goals and all these things Okay, I accepted that he would go on to become a master fundraiser mashallah So he definitely was persuaded. I accepted it and I moved from Cambridge to New Jersey",
      "New Jersey. The office was in New York and I found a nice place in Teaneck, New Jersey so I... They would go on to eventually vote a Muslim mayor? Yes! It's a very nice city. That's right. So I moved there with my family, with my children and the office was next to the United Nations. So used to go every Juma'ah there and pray at the United Nation",
      "people from different countries there and very often I used to give khutbah at their So it spent about One year or so at In New Jersey then I realized that I have to finish my PhD Can I just leave it you had done the course all the time? My thinking right that I used go sometimes to Columbia University library and continue doing something with too far to travel from",
      "to travel from Teaneck all the way to Columbia. It was not that kind of a way, like you go to Widener Library and everything is accessible. Wideners Library is a great library with more than a million books. Anything that you look for, you'll find it there. Then other libraries at Harvard, 90 libraries at that time. That kind of atmosphere I was missing so I told Dr. Amasal",
      "told dr. I'm sorry I have to go back and finish my PhD so they agreed and this is all right yeah go and but when you try to finish as quick as possible so alhamdulillah went back moved actually the whole household we moved back to Cambridge Massachusetts and he found another apartment at Harvard Peabody Terrace",
      "My parents were visiting, so they were also with us. Alhamdulillah and I started working on my thesis now Although somewhat a little involved in the community but mostly it was for thesis So it took me about five months to finish that In 1978 I submitted my thesis And alhamdulilah it was accepted",
      "then I decided, of course at the office in New York they were waiting. They wanted me to come back so I went back. So we moved back and that is a time when we went to Teaneck. Okay right. So Omar had asked about the now very famous Hajj trip that was sponsored. When I came to the Islamic",
      "In 77, 76-77 there was this Hajj group. I had very good contact with Imam Barisuddin and... By this point you hadn't met him already? At this point, you'd already met him? Yeah, we met him and then Imam Siraj Wahad used to come almost every other week to my office. Because he's in Brooklyn. We had a good discussion, Alhamdulillah.",
      "So at that time they decided to have Imam, you know, what is it? Imam Wajid Deen's father Elijah Muhammad. He died in 1975 and he became the head of the organization and he tried to bring the people closer to the Sunni Islam, to mainstream Islam",
      "he also told his imams of the black community that they should go to Hajj and Muslim World League hosted them okay so each one they purchased their own ticket but once they arrived Makkah they were guests of Muslim world league and their accommodation food",
      "Dr. Sakhal asked me to accompany the group he himself did not go oh, he was there Imam Siraj and a number of people many some of their senior Imams today they recognized that we were there so we actually had a charter flight okay yeah some of this I've heard because we had of course Imam Sirach has been on the podcast and he shared his experiences",
      "recall he was an Imam in Chicago, Imam Ibrahim Ismail. He's like the father-in-law to Shaykh Hamza. Anyway, he's from Chicago. He was there on that trip. Yeah, we were from Los Angeles. We have several Imams. Imam Abdul Karim Hassan, one of the Syrian Imams, he was with us. So we were together almost more than 200. There you go. Wow! It was a big group.",
      "And we were all in one plane. Yeah. And I used to go to the cockpit and speak, telling them about Hajj. Oh! On the journey? Yes. The charter plane like you said. At that time, long before 9-11. Of course, you could go into the cockpit. You can go and you can speak and do that. So it's for our charter flight. That's right. Nobody else except Muslim. Right.",
      "did that and in this journey also my wife was with me and she was with the sisters of the African community and so they had a good interaction one or so he spent almost two weeks yeah and that there were number of speakers from Arab countries scholars",
      "and at that time. From Egypt? From Egypt, and he spoke, gave several lectures. Amazing. And I was used to translate these lectures. Wow, amazing, masha'Allah. And then other people came. Yasir Al-Fat was there, and they asked me to translate him for you. So I had to do that too. And a number of other people. Right.",
      "good time, good conversation. And after... So I was at the center and at the office of the Muslim World League as the head of the religious affairs department. That means contact with all the Islamic centers in US and Canada and Islamic organizations",
      "to them, providing Islamic literature for them. When is the... We published a translation of the Quran of Marbuduq Piktal. Was by the Muslim World League? Muslim World Union published more than 100,000 copies of that. I've seen that edition. It was edited with certain minor changes and beautiful printing cover that was done. And they distributed it to Islamic centers. Wonderful.",
      "Wonderful. I'm really curious, kind of at the big picture level, are you starting to see now more and more momentum across the country with interest in Islam among the Muslim community? Or did that begin a little later in the 1980s? When from your perspective did you see kind of the shift and the acceleration of the interest and the the acceleration building of masjids and so forth? Slowly we saw the growth of Islamic centers",
      "Islamic centers in the 70s and of course, in the 80s became much more but they were there. So it was no more just student organization but a strong organization that was a community organization and this immigrant community and then for American communities so there was some interaction with the American community",
      "So after when we came back from the Hajj, that Imam Wael al-Siddin allowed his people, the Imams of his community to take more lessons. And then Muslim World League and Imam Muhammad University of Riyadh and Umm Al Qura University of Mecca together they organized a",
      "Organized a training program for imams and this program was heard it never will close to Chicago That's the one that in my memory. Yes, yes there what? Hundred amounts or so they came There were scholars who came from Mecca To give lectures And also I taught a course on comparative religion",
      "religion to all the imams so and this was like one month-and-a-half program hmm so they were staying in a hostel and now that rented by this is an all these scholars were coming from different places yeah in",
      "I went to my cover and I was at Harvard actually. I took a few days for weeks often And then when this training program happened, are you all fairly had finished my PhD? Yeah now That was 78 79 right and then So I was involved with the With Muslim or league",
      "League and the community work. And during this time I received an invitation from Washington, Islamic Center of Washington that they are looking for a director for the Islamic center because Dr. Abdul Raoof he was retiring after almost 10 years",
      "10 years of service. He was retiring and they said that we want, if you could come and take the position. So I consulted with people at Muslim World League and I got a leave of absence without pay of course. So they said yes, you can go so that's how I moved from New York to Washington.",
      "Because you're the first guest we've actually had on this show who's talked extensively about Muslim World League. Could you spend maybe just a few minutes for our listeners who are not as familiar with, especially in the 70s and 80s, that was a big name. That name is no longer as common anymore. You don't hear about the Muslim World Week except in history books. The Muslim World League was established in the 60s. I was actually there in Medina,",
      "the Muslim League was established. It was established during the time of conflict between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. So Abdul Nasser was, for Arab nationalism and all of this thing, there were some... Problems between Saudi and Egypt, so Egypt establishes its own groups at that time",
      "Saudi Arabia. They thought that to have a Muslim world, inviting people so first meeting was held in Mecca and many people scholars from all over the world were brought and they came and they said that Ramadan was one of the convener. And Muhammad Sawaf and Abu Rasul Nalini Nadawi and other people and Muhammad Udi.",
      "So it is a religious body, just like after that King Faisal established OIC. It's called Organization of Muslim Conference. Islamic Conference. Yeah, so it had its headquarters. That was the political body and Muslim only or the religious body. And then Muslim only started establishing offices all over the world",
      "all over the world and one of the office was for United States which was also for us and United Nations hmm and dr. Sarkar was chosen to be that the director of that office so there they had Islamic centers Islamic schools financially as well other ways people needed some help provided those helps",
      "and also sending teachers and imams to various centers, that means scholars either from overseas or from here. Their salaries were paid by the Muslim World League. So why did this organization kind of peak and then not really stick around? After 9-11, of course, these offices are all closed because what happened",
      "what happened in 9-11. Of course. The terrible thing is Saudi Arabia had to reduce its activity. I see. You're saying, because I stopped, I thought in the 80s, late 80s is when Muslim World League became less you know as famous as they were in the 60s and 70s. Dr. Sarkar left. Okay, see I think there was a lot of turnover. I left. And then other organizations I think also filled voids that were more national based. True.",
      "True. So we have other Islamic groups and organizations that came, these are more local organizations.",
      "an invitation from the Islamic Center of Washington which is, of course that beautiful it's with all the embassies beautiful building. When was it? It was very nice but at the same time it was a terrible time because of hostage crisis 1979 Iranian revolution and all of that That is the period of time? Yeah that was late so 79 yeah I came uh",
      "and hope that I'm going to be at the capital of the country, and a great center, beautiful center. But what happened? That I found almost every week demonstrations outside the center because it was very political atmosphere. Demonstration against one country or the other country, against this, against that. Student bodies making demonstration",
      "making demonstrations, people make demonstrations. And the center was it's like board of governors were ambassadors of the Muslim countries. It's in a row of embassies. I mean, I've been there right? So that can imagine if it's people protesting lot of political upheaval is going on then... I kind of felt that I'm not in the right place. Yeah, I see.",
      "about a year and a half. I thought you almost said an hour and a hal, because you were like one hour, I'm done. DC is enough for one hour that's all you can stand. So I was thinking to go back to my job at West New Orleans but at the same time not sure whether should I go or not go someone came from Orange County",
      "from Orange County okay and visited me and bless our brother Adam what I see who came and so he saw what was happening and you saw worry on my face they said look like you're not a happy happy here and we have established an organization",
      "And we are looking for somebody to lead the organization, be the director, religious director imam here. So come and visit us. If you like, you can join us. That's dangerous because one visit to California and you're sold. That was the first time I came to California. And here you are, 40 years. And they, of course, arranged my children to go to Disneyland.",
      "got into oh there you go that was the that was a selling point for them right it's icing on the cake yeah you gotta get everybody on the family on board right so by this time i came here and spent a few days and then i uh i went back to washington okay and now brothers from here from the slum society of orange county",
      "we'd like you to come, we'd liked you to go. My family and others they said let's go so we decided I came here in September 1981. September 1981 so this September will make 40 my math is not right. It's just been 40 years it's just",
      "yeah we just more than 40 years no i just finished this september will be 41 22. 41 yes yeah that's what i was saying i'm trying to do math quick you're the engineer come on so i am the center was very small center was really small but just one building and uh the old church that was converted into a masjid which we are using now several offices",
      "Property has always been here. At that time, what would you estimate the community? I mean on Friday we used to have like a hundred people for prayer and then we had Eid prayer half of the masjid was there. Was Islamic Center of Southern California already established? Islamic Center was there Dr. Mahirat Tooth was there",
      "Okay. Center in the county and there was another center, African American center in Los Angeles. In LA? In LA. Los Angeles? In Riverside, there were three or four centers at that time. Small. Yeah. And this was also a small community. Right. So I came and accepted. And your children said Disneyland. So, okay.",
      "I was living in front of the Islamic Center for Washington, nice big house. Three floors and nine bedrooms. But I came here just took a small house three bedroom and rented it. And then we started our life here in California Alhamdulillah. It was...",
      "back sorry yeah your mic yeah this is fun that's not worth it yes always better to stop and edit yeah sorry and then the other thing you use but something happened",
      "And then move this way you can still see darkness. Yeah, do you have the benefit that you are? Yeah, there's your benefit your benefit is you don't any gear yeah, so you can move exactly very good now this ship this around however you want it Maybe that would be a perfect okay, okay, and then just time check as well What time I don't want to keep you look 50 degrees. Yeah",
      "Yeah, okay. Where'd I where he said three o'clock? Yeah. Yeah So we can kind of skip to 9-11 base skip tonight No, no way. We want to talk a little bit about it's now 9-eleven and then what you're gonna conclude with your advice to the community Yeah What do you think some of the challenges are now obviously years after nine that's the really interesting part so let's talk So that would be the kind of agenda for them here. So I want you to yeah, you know Pace your story, you yourself according to those make I guess 3 or 4 main areas",
      "three, four main areas that we wanna cover. Okay? So you were in the middle of something. Remind me where we were exactly. What were you seeing? After coming here I found there was a lot of activity on the east coast but in the west coast not much. Few centers but they had not much activity. They did not know each other and all those things so I thought that we should do something to activate",
      "activate the West Coast and so I suggested to the community here that we should have a Sira conference. And so we had an international Sira Conference, that was something that excited the people, Sira and International and with my acquaintance",
      "scholars from overseas here and we organized that Alhamdulillah it was very successful. And then people said that we should have it again, and we started doing that every other year so we continued for almost 20 years this conference and it became like it put us on the map. I was gonna say... People scholars and those who come and",
      "Southern California community to come closer. So various centers, actually in the very first meeting we brought about the imams and the presidents of various Islamic centers to meet. And that became the beginning of the Shura Council of Southern California which was established later in 1995 but that was community relations so it helped",
      "help both growth of the Islamic society we started purchasing the adjacent properties so we have now about six acres of land and it's like society was surrounded by dog kennels by dog canals Oh 300 dogs on the right side this area",
      "This area just was known for dog kennels. Okay, yeah used to hear like Barking of the dogs at the time of prayers and all those things Yeah, when there were any rain or anything like that So it's I used to pray Allah help us so that we can get rid of this. Yeah And Alhamdulillah, so we are able to get clean the whole area. Hmm. Yeah The carry street was not a paved Street",
      "the street and sometime during the night people used to come and drink and throw the bottles on our property so I put a fence there and persuaded the city to make a paved state that have more light and all those things right so alhamdulillah clip area became clear and clean and safe for everybody and family started coming moving in this in this area right so Alhamdulilah Islamic Center developed",
      "a school here okay in 1983 we established our orange crescent school right which has become one of the largest schools and should i counsel my involvement and then also I became adjunct professor at California State University Fullerton. Okay. I started teaching there",
      "course in comparative religion and a course in Islam. I started teaching two courses there at Fuller University, then also after that I was asked at Cal State Long Beach to teach a course there and then Chapman University asked me so I could have, there was an offer that I become full time",
      "full time at the university, but I somehow got busy with all this activities here and with ISNA. So I did not accept that. Your involvement with ISNAM again, well obviously you were already involved with the MSA. Had ISNA developed like a fiqh council or that comes later? The Religious Affairs Committee became the fiqhh council. Understood. Dr. Tahir Jaber Alwani,",
      "He was the head of the committee. A giant. And he is the one who changed it to the Fiqh Council. I see. And in 2008, he wrote to me and he said, I want you to take over the FiQh Council, and so then I became the head",
      "I started actually reading a lot. Probably, obviously not your writings but Pakistan Link The Pakistan link used to do a column with you You did a column at the Pakistan link Pakistan link was a magazine here locally? Locally And so it was Q&A People would send in questions for fatwa essentially like fiqh questions and Dr Siddiqui would answer them But what Pakistan link did was amazing",
      "It was amazing. In the early days, this is like internet, you know, beta internet, not even Internet 1.0. This is internet, beta Internet. Pakistan Link had a website and they compiled all of Dr. Siddiqui's responses. So you would go there and it was searchable index. You know, this isn't still right for 90s. Yeah, it's pretty advanced.",
      "you know his responses like and then so then what i did was yeah saving the questions and answering them on a weekly basis that's right every friday also i started a radio program okay through pakistan kind of familiar with this thing your microphone set up so i used to have a weekly radio program in the beginning it was lectures that i used",
      "one hour. And then after that, I started doing the Quranic lessons. MashaAllah, yeah. So it continued for about 20 years or so. Wow. See now, that didn't reach us in Houston but Pakistan link, I remember the articles used to reach us and so then what I did was I printed them all out. This is old school. Printed out, you know, wasted a whole bunch of trees and then put them in binders. And we used to use your fatwas as like discussion conversations for our halakas.",
      "for our halakha in Houston. So you've been a part of my life for a very, very long time even though I wasn't part of your community here Mashallah. So then when I went to ISNA in 94' I finally saw you and said okay so this is Dr. Muzamil Siddiqui. And years later we would invite you to Houston with the organization that we were running and you came in 1999.",
      "So Alhamdulillah, it was growing. Then we had our convention in Chicago. That was the big one. Which was about 12,000 people or so. And then after that... 20,000, 40,000. 40, 000, yes. It's a very large number. So you served as president until 2001? Yeah almost. So 9-11 you were President? I was... Sheikh Mohammed Noor became after me. Sheikh Mohammed Abla... He has not taken yet his position.",
      "position. So that fell on your watch? I was there and then this terrible thing happened. Right. The 9-11, I was in Washington at the time. Traveling. Were you there already? Yeah, I wasn't there. And then of course for again a lot of people who probably saw you on television. When then this happened, of course I could not travel so I was grounded my brother's home in Virginia",
      "second day or third day, I received a call from the White House that there will be a prayer service at the National Cathedral. They said would you come and join the President and give a prayer? I said of course it will be an honor. So I went there and had they asked me to make it for more than two minutes",
      "two minutes. It was very nice. I have to say... And then write down everything and they edited it. Oh, it was edited? Took out something at the same time but that was... So as people like us who were living 9-11 and obviously you know the horrors of that day. At there at the time everybody almost everybody there. All the presidents were there. That's what I mean so for us as Muslims now you're seeing from the layperson",
      "from the layperson responding, within days. One it was George Bush's visit to the mosque in Baltimore that I remember and then the prayer service. I don't remember the timeline but these three things happened together all at once that gave majority of us who were living and experiencing the fear of what's going to happen not only for Muslims but just the shock of what had already happened.",
      "were of such comfort and solace to us. And I think I speak to a good chunk of Americans, Muslim Americans when I say this. One was that visit to the mosque in Baltimore. The other was the prayer service where you gave the prayer and you represented the Muslims. And then I think the third would be Laino Sheikh Hamza Yusuf being at the address that the president gave",
      "he was there. And so again, I don't remember the timeline but you know just your words seeing it on ABC First was the prayer Because that was like two days after three days after Tuesday was 9-11 Friday was the Prayer Service Right So that was the first thing that happened And that was around noon time Okay Had the service and then after that immediately I went to the Islamic Center for prayer That was the same day? Same day Oh",
      "and in the prayer service you had a senior push yeah and then also carter and then uh clinton um number of other presidents were there right so i remember that they all i was sitting",
      "to the prayer and like I sit down so senior bush he winked towards me this is good right and uh clinton said like that gave you like a an oh you did it like an okay sign yeah and winking is probably like the texas hello yeah friendly then i after that we went to them",
      "the police room, and there President Bush came. And he shook hands with all of us and said thank us. We expressed our sorrow and sadness. So then I said that after your election we the Muslims wanted very much to meet with you as leaders but this thing happened, could not. So he invited us a week after that.",
      "to the White House and met us there. And so, they were only 15 of us, 15 Muslim leaders from the country. They were there. So Dr. Mahira Tooth was with us and Agha Saeed. Agha Sayed, the late Rahimullah also. Yeah, Rahim Allah and a number of other people. Right. But the people who gathered there",
      "he took few of those, I was inside the Oval Office. So I would be in the Ovil Office and he said you did a heck of a good job. Heck of a Good Prayer. Very George Bush Junior terminology there. Heck Of A Job Brownie after Katrina. Yeah exactly. So i had to take copy of the Quran with me",
      "we gathered, stood up, went close to him and said to him that I'm told by some people that you read Bible every day. He said yes I do. I said well sometime if you like to read Quran also and you see that whatever happened it had nothing to do with the Quran so he said okay. I don't know whether he did or not but he said that",
      "like that and then we were taken to the Roosevelt room. And they were all the other brothers who are from the Muslim community, they were there sitting there. And the whole media was all over. Suddenly they came and he put the Quran in front of him and I was sitting next to him because he asked me to sit next to it. And then he said to the media, the Imam has given me a copy of the Quran.",
      "I think I saw pictures of this event.",
      "national address and we Dr. Sheikh Hamza Yusuf was there, other people. Actually he was going after the prayer service, he was to New York to the Ground Zero. And the media asked me if I would join but I could not make it. I wish I had gone there. So they were thinking that if I go with the president there at the Ground zero. But he invited me after",
      "And for the five years, they had a meeting at the ground zero. Oh, the anniversary of 9-11. I went there. You know, I mean, say what... I think a lot of Muslims who look back at that time, who either were not around or people who were present, I think they react very differently to what happened because people who weren't around during 9-12 and they only read about it and then they see what happened, the wars and so on,",
      "I'm not by any means condoning what George Bush did in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "So, like for those who lived it, you know, there wasn't – yeah. Like there could have been an immediate reaction by the administration to not go out of their way, which is what they did. To go out on their way to make sure that the Muslim community in America felt safe. Like for the president to one of the first orders of business to do a prayer service and then to invite Dr. Muzammar Saddili, for him to visit a major Islamic center in DMV,",
      "in that area, like Detroit, in the D.C. metro area. Those are all big things and like he, like Dr. Siddiqui just said, you know, he held the Quran and said that the Imam gave me this to read and I, you now, that's going out of your way to make sure that the Muslims in America felt safe. And that says a lot. I mean again, not withstanding the wars and everything else George Bush did, foreign policy. Exactly. Because I think that",
      "Because I think that there's a very real chance that had things gone the other way, you know, if it was Trump, who knows, whatever. If somebody else was in office, I think things could have been very different for Muslims in America after 9-11. So, for those of us who lived it. But anyway, as we begin to sort of conclude, first of all, thank you again for your generosity with your time. You're still serving full-time as Imam here at the...",
      "at the Islamic Center of Orange County? Yeah, I'm religious director here. Religious director, okay, mashallah. So what advice, I guess as you've seen this community grow and blossom, me and Omar were just talking about this last night, the tremendous amount of wealth and resources that we now have as a community. We've gone from building Islamic centers to schools",
      "and other, you know now we have registered academic institutions that are certified and recognized by their local state and national bodies whether it's Zaytuna College or Darul Qasim in Chicago just got their accreditation so you've seen the growth of the community so from your perspective what do you see as the challenges sort of going forward Alhamdulillah",
      "love you thank allah and it should be very grateful to allah as well as our community yeah especially a lot of scholars and imams and leaders who have been working and trying to establish good relations with other people",
      "all of this, we have meetings with them. So we should appreciate all this especially our relation and then also your involvement in the government regardless whether we agree with certain policies or we don't but our involvement is very important. We have to participate and see that there is peaceful atmosphere if nobody should do any stupid thing or this horrible thing that happened at 9-11",
      "we have to make sure about that. We have to work together on that and also correcting the image of Islam because a lot of people after 9-11 they associate Islam with terrorism, horrible violence and all those things so Alhamdulillah people have worked very hard on that to bring a better understanding but still we need that.",
      "with wisdom, with understanding. Statements alhamdulillah now people used to say whatever they want to say and the khutbahs and all those things but it is very important for you to watch their words and say the right thing in the right way. Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom with good preaching that we should do. Alhamdulilah most people are doing that",
      "So and this is the what is needed very much our imams Mashallah some of them are excellent highly educated very articulate Imams in different places and more and more al-chahl are coming. This is what they have to do and pay attention to masajid I know it's not easy to stick to someplace but It needs some patience that needs some working with a community right?",
      "very, very important that we should have that. And you know political involvement as well participation in the election. Right local level national level. You have to raise the consciousness of the people bring the right kind of candidates so that we understand them and listen to them. Of course our religious organization cannot endorse any candidate but",
      "who are the people and they're there they are Democrats or we are Republican that is contributions participation involvement helping volunteer work all these people sometimes they think that it's just an election time but action time is not the only time",
      "We should always be involved in that.",
      "capture the stories of people and the giants in our community, and the pioneers of our community whose shoulders we stand on. I keep saying that but you know when you're sitting across someone with someone like Dr. Siddiqui it's hard not to say that because you see here in the presence of the Giants and the Pioneers of our Community so may Allah preserve you give you good health. Mashallah you have four children I want to I don't want to leave without asking about your grandchildren how many grandchildren do you have? Ten grandchildren and one great-grand. Wow!",
      "Wow. There you go. As someone who's the age of our parents, so please remember us and the show and our listeners in your duas. And as always, listeners, thank you for listening. We'll look forward to bringing you more episodes for the rest of the summer.

      "It's a beautiful dua that Rasulullah taught to his daughter. And he said, Fatima, don't forget that. You should say this dua morning and evening.",
      "And for those listening, you can translate? Yeah. Oh the Hayyan Qayyum. Ever-living. Known as some people say, Asmala ila Azam. This is the great name of Allah SWT. The only living one, the only one who maintains everything, manages everything. I seek your Rahma. I ask help through your Rahmat.",

      "اور میں نے محمد صلوات اللہ علیہ وسلم کے آخرے پروفٹ اور مسجد کی ایک چھوٹا سورہ ہے جس کا محبت ہے کہ اس سورة بلد کی تعلق ہے یہ مکہ کی قرآن سے بڑی بھی گزارنے والا ہے",
      "I swear by the city and you are the dweller of this city. I swear, by the begetter and whatever he begets. Indeed we have created man in prevail does he think that no one has power over him? He says I have a squandered vast riches does it think that",
      "did not make for him two eyes, a tongue and two lips, and showed him two ways. Yet he does not take the highway. What will make you realize what is that high path? It is freeing the captive or feeding on a lean day",
      "some orphan relative or some needy person in distress and to be one of those who believe and exhort one another to perseverance and to mercy these shall be the people of the right side whereas those who deny our signs shall be",
      "this is an early Makkan surah and here Allah SWT is pointing to a problem that some of the people of Mecca had and the problem is the Mecca was of course a commercial town sometimes",
      "لہذا مکہ میں رائے لوگ تھے جو اچھا کرنے والی اور ان کے پاس دیکھتے تھے کہ وہ اس کا مال کو شروع کریں گے لیکن وہ بھی کسی چیز سے صرف نقصان نہیں کیا اور سردار میں انہوں نے انہیں اپنے آپ کو حفاظت کرنا چاہئے۔",
      "there is a way downhill and there is the way upward. The word downhill is that you live your life the way you live, the word upward is take care of the poor and the needy provide for them, take care",
      "That is the way to free the slave, to take care of the poor, to provide for the needy. And those who do that and remind others about patience and compassion, they are the ones who are the people of the right side.",

      "Do you know? Have you considered someone who denied the religion? Who is saying that the day of the religion is a lie. Belying the religion or who does not believe in the day judgment, That is the person who repulses the orphan and does not remind people himself and others to take care of the needy",

      "place to another we understand that there are laws immigration law their border protection is there and all of these things but at the same time there has to be some compassion some understanding not everybody who is migrating is a criminal and you should not say that because simply because of their their race is different their color is different",

President has the powerful to protect, safeguard the borders. Nobody can. This is not the issue. The issue was what's the policy just or not? Singling out some countries especially Muslim countries",

Yes, they can be stopped. They should be stop but what about the sweeping statement? Five or seven Muslim countries and then any other country as well We are saying no country Should be targeted",
      "No country should be singled out. But only those who do wrong, they said yes, they should be stopped. That's injustice. That is not justice. That policy is not a fair policy. That policies are good policy. It has to be challenged and we as Muslims living in this country our responsibility is not just to protect ourselves, we have to protect all the people who are wronged done to them",

That is the selfishness, that is the greed that is happening today. And then you hear the news about the Muslims of China,",

They're not allowed to say that they are Muslims, they're not supposed to pray, they are not supposed fast, they don't read the Quran, even their names were considered as a crime to have Muslim names.

      "Zikr of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala. So after every fourth prayer, we say Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar La ilaha illa Allah Allahu Akbar Alllahu Akbar walillahil hamd And those of you who can afford make sacrifice if you cannot do it here there are a lot of people in different places they need meat poor people and they have Islamic relief they have their booth outside",
      "outside you can make arrangement through them wherever you want in any country if we can do that and other groups that are doing that so inshallah Allah accept that the purpose of sacrifice yes it is to help the people with the meat but Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala does not need meat Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala doesn't eat blood Allah Subhaanahu wa Tlaa needs the piety of the heart",
      "To Allah does not reach the blood and the meat But what reaches to Allah is the piety of your heart. So you have piety in your heart Sincerity in your hard, and that is what is going to bring the reward from inshallah And then also as I reminded you about praying for the people of Kashmir Praying for the People of Palestine Praying For The People Of Rohingya",

      "observe all prayers in the month of Ramadan together in Jama'ah. So time comes, of course you know what is time of Fajr, times Zohar and Asan and Maghrib and Ishaa, all of these things but what time are you going to pray? In the family, what time everybody will be there? So you say I'm going we are going to play Fajra at five o'clock or 5 30 whatever time you want look at the calendar see",
      "After your suhoor, wait for a few minutes and then Fajr prayer. And then Zohar prayer, put the time for that. What time you are going to pray? 1.15, 1.30 whatever what time you pray. For Asr, what time we're going to do Asr prayer? Check your calendar and see what and then select a time for yourself. This is the time we are going",
      "everybody knows what time the Sun sets. You may not know but during Ramadan people pay very much attention, they know every second when the sun is going to set and when the star time comes. Have your star and then after that have your maulid prayer together and then set a time for Isha prayer. Don't delay too much because you want to sleep or the night will be short so pray Isha",
      "after that you pray Tawheed prayers and talk about that. So schedule, prayer schedules that you do that. And then as you know most of the families do that during Ramadan we normally plan that we'll have family get together friends get together what we call iftar party or iftar gathering",
      "Many families do that. Or they go to the masjid and have star, contribute for their stars. A large number of people can have a star. So you have some budget for them. You plan that I'm going to have a Star Gathering program at home or somewhere else and this much money we are going to spend on that but this year you cannot do that",
      "You cannot have your star gatherings because it's a social distance time. It is only within the family you do so this money that you used to spend or you are planning to spend, give it to charity. Give it to your masjid. Masajis are in need.",
      "various Islamic charities, give it to some poor people that you know. So it is good to use this money and this is given for a good cause. Also there are people who give Zakat during the month of Ramadan. The Zakat doesn't have to be paid during the months of Ramadan but if you pay in the month",
      "and know how much Zakat you are going to give, then give it in the month of Ramadan. It can help because a lot of people need it. So give them Zakat those who are poor and needy and learn the rules of Zakat and then give Zakat accordingly. And also Sadaqatul Fitr is given during the month Ramadan. So Sadaquatul fitr is the special charity of the month",
      "This is for the poor and needy people. Normally you pay Sadaqatul Fitr before Eid prayer, but this Ramadan because you know that a lot of people are in need, families are in needs so try to pay it as soon as possible during the month of Ramadan. It is about ten dollars per person in the family, those who are supposed to pet the cat",
      "cat, they also have to pay sadaqat al-fitr. Ten dollars per person in the family, head of the household supposed to pay on his or her behalf and all others young or old male or female on behalf of everyone ten dollars you pay it. You can give it your masjid and the masjids will distribute among the poor or you yourself give it to the poor when they need it.",
      "These are some of the physical things that should be done for preparation and thinking, that you do it for a month of Ramadan. Then we come to the spiritual aspect. The spiritual aspect is very important. Number one, Tawbah and Istighfar. Make istighfar, ask Allah",
      "Ask Allah to forgive you. Because when you seek forgiveness, then your Ibadah becomes better. The Quran says seek forgiveness from Allah and turn towards Allah. Turn to Allah first of all tell him O Allah forgive me. Have mercy on me. I have done a lot wrong and I need your blessing.",
      "blessing. Turn to Allah SWT, seek forgiveness and also seek forgiveness from your family members, your friends, anyone you have offended, everyone you anyone you",
      "try to pay it off. Seek forgiveness, seek forgiveness of each other so your conscience is clear, mind is clear inshaAllah and then you are ready to receive the blessings of Allah SWT. That's Islamic way, Islamic ways first cleanse and then they say more. In shaAllah that you will receive that. So seek forgiveness and turn to Allah",
      "and this is the preparation, spiritual preparation. The heart must be clean. It's not going to help you, it's not gonna improve you unless inside it becomes clean just like wudu you do and then you pray your body is clean. You have to wud of the heart,",
      "no grudge, no anger, no deceit, no bad feelings. Everything is out! Turn to Allah and then you will see what a joy you will receive for fasting. How beautiful it becomes to fast. Turn to ALLAH SWT. Second thing in your spiritual preparation is that you make an intention",
      "receive the deeds, receive the blessing by the intention. So your intentions sincere intention for the sake of Allah. All deeds of course you receive the blessings for that but especially fasting",
      "fasting. I will give a special blessing for fasting. Make your intention that you are going to fast for the sake of Allah and you are gonna fast the whole month, every day you make an intention but you can also make an intension for the whole",
      "sick, fever or headache a problem and difficult for him to fast then Allah has allowed. If you are sick then you can make it up later. Sometimes you have temporary sickness that comes and goes and makes it difficult for you to fast but you're not allowed to fast on the day. And sometimes people are sick they cannot fast the whole month",
      "or women during their menstruation cannot fast. So these people have to make it up later, and some people cannot even make it later. Sickness continues. If sickness continues, وَعْلَى الَّذِينَ يُكِيخُونَهُمْ فِرِيَةٌ تَعَامُوا مِسْكِينًا And those who cannot do it then they have to give Fidya.",
      "Tridia is for every day's fast missed you feed a poor person and feeding the poor person means that you give two meals to a poor or you can give money for two meals. The money for the two meals average is about $12, six dollars per meal so twelve dollars",
      "$12 for every day of fast that you miss, which you cannot make it. You cannot make qadaa. First thing is qadaaa. First to make it up but if you cannot do the fast then the fidya in that case and for the whole month you can not fast then you give the fidy either at the beginning or in the middle of Ramadan give the fidiya for the",
      "important that you have intention and planning for that. The third thing is spiritual, for the fasting month, is that you pray five daily prayers as I mentioned five daily",
      "unfortunately Muslims who fast but they don't pray. Allah has made us that you have Iman, Shahada and then Salat and then comes Zakat and then come Siyam. So fasting is important but Quran says again and again",
      "our fourth also. So it is very important that you pray five times and as I mentioned before, pray together in Jama'at. Pray together and also there is a special prayer in the month of Ramadan, Tarabih Prayer. Tarabikh Prayer is Sunnah Muwakkadah. Sunnah muwakkada means it is a sunna but it is highly emphasized",
      "and it should not be missed. You must pray a Tarawih prayer. It is nice that people gather in the masjid, praying Jama'at, listen to the Quran but since it will not be possible go to the Masjid and pray in Jama'ah you can have it at home. You can pray by yourself.",
      "but it is good to pray in Jama'at with your family. And if you have somebody, mashallah a Hafiz in the home, in the family let that person recite the Quran at home. If there is no Hafiz at home then whosoever knows the Quran more should recite and read the prayer.",
      "Quran, many surahs of the Quran, besides short suras of the Qur'an. You can repeat if you only know four or five surah well repeat them. You do that. Or if you want to have a Mus'haf in your hand copy of the quran in your",
      "The Quran app, you open the Quran app and recite. Not listen to somebody else's recitation but you yourself recite the Quran. But if you get a problem with mobile phone is that you will be disturbed by messages coming WhatsApp messages and other things are coming and people sometimes get distracted",
      "That's why it is better to have Mus'haf in your hand. If you are reading from your mobile, and then after that you see a message and turn towards the person asking who sent the message, your prayer will be gone. You'll have to start all over again. For this reason, it is important to have mus'hafs if you want to.",
      "It is permissible in Nawafil, Nafl prayers and Sunnah prayer to read from the Mus'haq. And after that you can pray 8 rakah or 20 rakahs, and you pray a vitr prayer inshallah, also sit down together and make dua.",
      "or you can sit down and make dua after that, and get up early for tahajjud prayer. And also for sahur. The hikaf we do in the month of Ramadan especially in the last 10 days is done only in the wassit. You cannot do it at home.",
      "at home. Allah says in the Quran, وَأَنْتُمْ عَاكِفُونَ فِي الْمَسَّاجِدِ The itikaf is in the masjid. If you want to do itikāf, we cannot do it this year. So ask Allah SWT to give you long life and good health so that you can do it next year inshaAllah. You have an opportunity to do that. But still you can pray al-layl at your home",
      "many other Nawafil you can pray and Azkar you can do, of course try to finish the whole Quran in your personal reading. Let me read one Juz at least every day so that in this month every person, every Muslim reads the Quran. Read the Quran, do the Tilawa",
      "spend a little more time and understand the meaning that is better even not just really with reading with understanding shooting that you do inshallah see the month ago and then you'll feel very satisfied in show fulfilling one very uplifting very inspiring",
      "this month will be a very blessed month. I know that it is sad that our masajid are closed, but you are not going to miss anything that is obligatory in the month of Ramadan because you are unable to go to the mosque. You can pray at home, you can fast, you have your suhoor, you",
      "have your staff, you can have all your narafil. You can do that at home. The only thing that you are going to miss is the gatherings of the people. As well as our obligations, our forayes, we will fulfill them inshallah. May Allah bless us, accept from us, keep us on",
      "yourself, pray for me, pray the Ummah. May Allah help us unite the Ummat and remove more difficulties especially people who are suffering in different parts of the world, suffering people in Palestine, suffering in Kashmir, suffering",
      "May you please people who are suffering. Ask Allah to remove their suffering and those who are sick because of coronavirus, may Allah give them shifa. Those who passed away, may God give them maqfara. Forgive them and bless them and give patience to their families. JazakAllah khairan wa salamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.",
      "God bless you for that. Is it okay if we ask people have questions, can we open it up for some questions? Do you want to ask some question? So if anybody has a question on the call please unmute yourself and feel free to ask the question or you can also just type the question in the chat window and then I'll...",
      "It's my understanding that women can do ithaka from home. So if you can please give us a little more information about that?",
      "Not all of them. Some have said it is permissible for women to have their atiqab at home, although in the time of the Prophet, his wives used to make atiikabs at the masjid. You can also make atikaab at the Masjid if you have a special place for them, they can do that. Okay because my understanding is most of the women back home I'm talking about are from India",
      "So, they usually have their ethic of they do it at their home. So yeah so especially if your husband can cook and serve you is very good. Yeah. Thank you so much really appreciate it. Anybody else?",
      "Since we will be mostly at home and making our tarawih at home now, is it better for us to delay our tarwih closer to the middle or end of the night? And then combine it with our Qiyam and then have suhoor and sleep. Or is it a better way to pray after Isha?",
      "the Ramadan Qiyam, and the other is Tihyaamul Layl, Tahajjud prayer. People sometimes confuse that Tarawih is like Tihayaamul layl or Tahajud prayer is different from Tarawihi. It's better to pray Tarawihin prayers after Isha prayer. But if you cannot and want to pray later,",
      "but the Ravi is supposed to be done a shop rare and then you sleep anybody else I think there was somebody else",
      "What are the plans for Eid day? Like what are your suggestions?",
      "in big gatherings. What you do is that the Imam of your Masjid can give a message and you listen to that message but you have your own prayer. You pray two rakahs, Eid Prayer is wajib according to Imam Abu Hanifa,",
      "Sunnah. Vajra is more important so that's why you have to pray two rakahs but it requires Jamaa, since there is no Jamaa you can pray Nafl at home. You can do it in Jamaa at your home or the family or you can do individually. Unfortunately we are going to miss Eid.",
      "This is the fatwa of many scholars here in America as well as in other places. During Ramadan, we will not have Jama'at prayer in the masajid and we will also not have Eid prayers.",
      "Does anybody else have a question? Please feel free to unmute yourself and ask your question. You can also type it if you want in the chat, and I can ask it for you.",
      "لا تأخذنا إن نسينا واختانا ولا تحمل علينا إسرا كما حملته على الذين من قبلنا ولا تحملنا مال طاقة لنا بعفو عنا وقفل لنا ورحمنا أنت مولانا فانصرنا على أطوم الكافرين اللهم ارفع عنا هذا البلاء اللهم يا حي قيوم برحمتك نستغيث",

      "our schedule for the month of Ramadan, our digital Ramadan schedule. Inshallah we'll have a Quran recitation daily for you as well as some spiritual upliftment by some of our local shayukhs. Keep connected with your masjid during this Ramadan although this will be virtual.

      "All praise is for Allah the Lord of the worlds",
      "all the prophets and messengers of Allah from Adam to Noah, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa and the last and final prophet Muhammad may peace and blessings of Allah be upon them, upon their families and upon their followers",
      "We all know the word Iman and very often we translate Iman meaning belief, faith. But actually our scholars they say Iman is not just faith and belief",
      "faith and belief. They say, This is the definition that is given in the books of Aqidah, in the book of Faith. This is a definition for Iman. Your heart says yes this is the truth. And you confirm the truth",
      "So you recognize that there is no God except Allah and Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is the messenger of Allah. And you recognize the Quran, and you recognize all the things that Allah SWT has mentioned, and say I believe in that. You say Ashadu! I bear witness for that. This is my conviction. Tasdikun bil qalb",
      "First of all, it has to be from the heart. The heart is the center and it must be from inside. If somebody just say by tongue, no enough not enough. It should be believed from inside to Tasdikun Bil Qalb. Tasdiq from the word Sidq. Sidq means the truth and Tasdiqu means say it is the truth. And the second thing is Iqraarun Billisain and then you say it by the tongue.",
      "affirm that by your tongue and you say i am muslim i believe in that islam is the way my way my",
      "How would you know? Allah knows, but we don't know. And we cannot call him part of the Ummah. So in order to become part of The Ummah You have to say by your tongue. Iqraarun Billisan And it is not enough to say in your heart that I believe and you say by Your tongue that I am Muslim. That is the third thing. And the third is Amalun Bil Arkaan",
      "you start acting according by your tongue, by your body. Arkaan is arkan al-jism, your body physically you are start acting on it or some people say arkaan means Al-Arkana Islam Al-Khamsa that is the five pillars of Islam Shahada Salat Zakat Siyam Hajj so Amalun Bil Arkaans you start",
      "So, you involve physically in that.",
      "and then you're belonging. You belong to a community, and this community is not a race community, it's not an ethnic community, It's not a nationalistic community, its not the community based on colors, it is the community of anywhere in the world. Universal Community! So we belong from the time of Adam, all the way to Muhammad. And then from now that on",
      "that on today. Allah SWT says all these people, Isa AS, Musa AS, Ibrahim AS, all the prophets of 124,000 prophets, all of them are one Ummah. Allah mentioned in Surat Al-Anbiya",
      "Allah mentioned all the Prophets of Allah and said, this is your Ummah. This is the Ummah of Muhammad. Well, of course after the coming of Muhammad, we are required to follow his Sharia, his way. So otherwise... but we do recognize, we cannot be believers unless we recognize Jesus, peace be upon him. We cannot be believer unless we recognized Musa. Unless we recognize Ibrahim,",
      "Islam all the prophets of Allah you know salish and I'm the only is that all of them so we recognize all of it to belong to this wide community universal community and then this here this world our lemma said that umma has three meanings one is the umma to dava that Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasalam came",
      "his ummah the whole world is his umma now everybody you walk on the outside in the street every person is the umma of muhammad because he came to invite everybody he's the last prophet universal prophet he came",
      "Allah said in the Quran, Say O Muhammad, O people I am the messenger of Allah towards all of you. Arsalnaaka ila annasi khafa. We send you to everybody. So everybody is supposed to follow him. So he came to invite everybody. And ulama say the second group of the ummah is Ummatul Ijabah.",
      "If you love Allah, follow me and Allah will love you.",
      "So that Allah SWT make us from among those people. And we can become, we belong. Yes? We belong. But at the same time Rasulullah SAW said So minni. Belong to me. As Ibrahim SAW says",
      "He said, those who follow me they belong to me. So those who belong to Rasulullah or those who followed Rasulallah and that's what we all have to work on that. So InshaAllah my brothers and sisters let us remember that our faith is believing belonging and behaving and behavior is very important and behind behavior is not simply Salat prayer",
      "Prayer. Behavior is not fasting during the month of Ramadan. Behavior, is whole life. Live that way. There are three Sahaba, Rasulullah, Abu Zar, Mu'adh ibn Jabal and Anas ibn Malik. All the three are great Sahabah. And it is mentioned in the Ahadith that they all came",
      "at the same time maybe one time and another time and they asked rasulullah for an advice say yeah oh sini give me an advice you're messenger of allah and the prophet gave them the similar advice same advice he gave them even though they were all very pious people but he still gave them this advice so don't think that i am too biased why should i take this advice no it is advice for even the great sahaba",
      "Abu Zar, very pious person. Mu'adh ibn Jabar, Anas ibn Malik, he was from the time when Rasulullah came to Madinah his mother brought him and said this Anas is a very intelligent boy I want that you keep him with you so that he may learn and he will serve you",
      "Anas was with the Prophet all the time. Serving the Prophet. And he learned a lot and Allah gave him long life, he lived long. So Anas ibn Malik is one of those people who also received this advice. Mu'adh ibn Jabal great Sahabi, Abu Dhar radiyaAllam",
      "And the advice is simple advice. The advice is, Very comprehensive advice. Simple advice, beautiful advice. This we call it in Arabic, we call this Easy but you cannot imitate it. You can not say anything like that.",
      "and the rasulallah summarized the whole islam in these three things the first thing is wherever you are fear allah wherever you have the taqwa of allah so fear allahu be mindful of allahu wherever you",
      "Fear Allah. Be mindful of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. And you see, Taqwa is the basic value of Islam. It is mentioned in the Quran many times. Allah subhana wa ta-ala says, O people be mindful of God. O you who believe, be mindful",
      "So you see, and Allah SWT says this is the advice that Allah gave from the beginning of history all the time to Muhammad SAW and his followers. وَلَقَدْ وَصَّيْنَا الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وْأَيَّاكُமْ وِالتَّقُّ اللَّهُ We told the people who were given the book before you and we are telling you have the Taqwa of Allah. Taqva of Allah SWt, Allah SWт giving this advice throughout history to all people.",
      "And Taqwa is, be mindful of Allah. Be mindful of the day you will be returning to Allah. So all of these things are there. Be Mindful of Allah, be Mindful Of The Day Of Judgment, be mindfulness of the punishment in Hellfire always.",
      "The second point that Rasulullah ﷺ gave is Islah. Continuously improve yourself, make yourself better and better. Ali said,",
      "Your today must be better than yesterday and your tomorrow must be even better than today. So what? أَدْبِعِ السَّيِّئَةَ الْحَسَنُّةَ تَمْحُهَا If you make any mistake, correct yourself immediately. Any evil deed should be followed up with a good deed. Mistakes are possible. Every human being can make mistakes.",
      "mistake whether they are you do it forgetfully or out of ignorance or maybe deliberately you do that as soon as you remember stop",
      "any shameful deed or do wrong to themselves they remember allah and they ask his forgiveness and who can forgive except allah? And they don't insist on the wrong. Don't keep on doing it knowingly, they don' t do that. So change yourself and how you change yourself? Change yourself by Tawbah, by Istighfar, by correcting the mistake,",
      "All of these things and Rasulullah said You follow up the bad deed with a good deed, and you will wipe it out Now our ulama they are very careful in explaining that They say That means he says you will Wipe it out. He said well of course you do not wipe it off Allah wipe it But here is referring to you",
      "by evil. Whether it is yourself or in the society. Always try to remove the evil by something good. So do good. If you make mistake, correct yourself and start doing right thing. If other people are doing mistake, then correct it but in a nice way, in a better way. Evil and good are not equal.",
      "Adhbi'a is sayyiat al-hasan, adhu tamuha",
      "People with courtesy, smile, tolerance, giving good advice.",
      "Be good to your wife also. Somebody says, why should I do that? You have to do that also. Be good for your children. Be Good to your neighbors. Be a good person in the mosque with whom you pray next to you. Be kind to them and be good to outside even when you are driving.",
      "The Prophet said, this is part of Iman. One part of the Iman is that you remove the obstacle from the road.",
      "Iman has more than 70 branches and one of the branch of iman is Imatatul Adha Ani At-Tariq You have seen a stone on the road? Remove it. You see a branch on the Road remove it Anything you try to correct it, you try make things better And you will receive reward for that Allah SWT bless you for that somebody went to Jannah because of that Because he removed an obstacle from the road",
      "And some people instead of removing the obstacle, they create obstacles. They create obstacles for others by their behavior, by their talk, by the way they look at the people. They can create obstacles It's very important that people should do that. That is what Islam is all about. We complain about people having this opinion, this opinion and this opinion about Muslims. May Allah guide them but we should start ourselves in the right way",
      "right way if you start doing good inshallah things will be getting better unless one teller knows what is going on so these beautiful advisors my brothers and sisters of allah prophet muhammad this is part of our email this is",
      "Alhamdulillah, alhamdulillahi rabbil a'lamin.",
      "Still, it's good to know more about it. There is a masjid, one of the oldest masjids in Southern California, in Los Angeles area. Oldest masjido. And this masjide is in the center of Los Angeles, south central Los Angeles. And his masjidi is known as Masjid Bilal Islamic Center of Los Angles. So it's 60-70 year old. It used to be called Temple of Muhammad 25",
      "25 when honorable muhammad he started preaching the message of course the message was not true authentic islam but he was telling some people and a lot of people accepted but then alhamdulillah his son imam wd muhammed rahmahullah",
      "and one of the imams, the oldest living Imam in Southern California. Masha Allah is strong, dynamic, active, is with us Alhamdulillah. Imam Abdul Kareem Hassan. Imam Abd al-Kareem has a history and if you don't know read his book called My Family's Evolution from Nationalism to Islam.",
      "i think every muslim in america should read that book eye opener how things were going and how things are and have they changed masha allah so this is uh this is the history and this is a beautiful masjid inshallah we hope that this must become a grand masjids in los angeles area because",
      "Who will, Insha'Allah, see the guidance of Allah SWT. And many people, Alhamdulillah have received the guidance but more and more people will come and benefit from that. Generations, inshallah are going to benefit from it. This is Sadaqa Jariyah. This a continuous charity that anyone who comes to this masjid and anyone who will be guided you will receive the reward from Allah SWt. As you know Rasulullah SAW said Ali in one place",
      "Ali, if Allah guides through you one person it is better than hundreds of red camels. Red camels were like Mercedes, like BMW at that time. It's expensive, expensive camel so they are better than many many red camel that you have.",

So patience in terms of controlling this, controlling this infection and the doctors are recommending, the governments are recommending certain steps that to be taken and we should not take them lightly.

      "can benefit some other ways to benefit yourself and stay as much as you can stay because that is going to help you so there's a lot of patience that is needed in staying home",
      "in terms of helping our relatives, our friends, our neighbors and people who are in need. We are supposed to have social distance physically but nobody says you cannot have relations",
      "of your care and kindness, you can call them. There are many other ways in which you can help them if they're in need. Maintain the social distance but at the same time keep yourself close to them in your heart, love and kindness. Your Islamic organizations,",
      "your massages are suffering because they're closed and they have to maintain the security, you may have to retain their cleanness. They have to remain some of their staff so you can donate, you can show your charity and kindness towards that. So helping the poor and the needy, helping Islamic institutions all of this requires patience",
      "that means your mind is in control and you are not under stress, you can do a lot. You can benefit people. And this infection may cause illness. It may cause the loss of life. May God protect us from that. It might cause financial loss. And it's already causing to a lot of people the financial loss",
      "loss. So we have to return to Allah and be patient. The Prophet said in the hadith, wonderful is the affair of the believer. Everything",

      "we accept that patiently but we pray to Allah to remove that so that's why prayer is important seek help with patience and prayer, be patient and pray and pray to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala let help you and remove the difficulty",
      "and come to your help because Allah is Qadirun ala kulli shay'in, He has power over everything. Our Prophet peace and blessing be upon him, when he was worried about something he would go to pray the first place where you go and",
      "your situation, your condition, your distress is to Allah. Speak to Him! Call upon him! And Allah says, إِذَا صَالَكْ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ أُجِيْبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إذا دَاعَانَ فَلْيَسْتَجِبُوا لِي وَلِيُؤْمِنُوا بِي رَعَلَّهُمْ يَرشِدونَ When my servant asks you concerning me I am near. I answer the call of those who call upon me.",
      "is ready to answer the call. If we pray with sincerity, devotion and paying attention to what we pray Allah's help will come. If there is any harm comes to you touches you that is no one can remove it except Allah",
      "ultimately it is Allah who removes. So, it is very important to pray. Pray in any situation standing sitting lying in your bed get up during the night and make the hajj prayer and ask Allah SWT to remove this problem and help us and ask forgiveness because problems come because of people's own mistakes",
      "So a lot of wrong has been done. We have been doing a lot wrong, individually and collectively. Individuals and states they have been wronged. And all of us have done what we are not supposed to do. We've done wrong to each other. We did injustice to others.",
      "justice to others. We have abused the resources. Allah has given us so much wealth, so much knowledge, so many know-how that we could have used it to remove poverty from the face of the earth. We could have given enough",
      "enough to provide the food for those who are in need. So there will be nobody would have gone hungry, the children could have free education, the sick would have free medicine. All of this you could have done plenty of resources available, but what did we do? Instead",
      "we abuse them, wasted them or we use them killing wars bombing weapons weapons of destruction that's what human beings have been doing and all these things they make Allah angry so we should ask Allah to forgive us and these moments",
      "These moments are the moments of learning. This is because we call it teaching moments. Allah is teaching us to take lessons and learn. Allah says in the Quran,",
      "because of what people have done, because of the work that people's hands have earned so that He makes them taste some of that which they have done. Not only that, but some of it, the taste of some crimes, some of abuses, misdeeds and corruption. Hopefully they will return to Allah",
      "and correct themselves. So correction is important, I hope this crisis, this affliction will make us better people and make us think about it all of us we have to think and reflect why this has happened? Why at such a large scale so it is needed that we return to Allah",
      "we turn to Allah, we turn our Creator, our Master. He is most Merciful, he's most compassionate and you can change that. O the Most Merciful have mercy upon us! We turn to You, we recognize our wrongdoings and the wrong doings of fools among us people who have authority and power",
      "in power, they have been acting foolishly. They have been selfishly in greed and they have not done what they are supposed to do. And we on our part, in our own area, we have not then what we're supposed to be doing. So we are all sinners, wrongdoers and we ask Allah to forgive us and have mercy upon us.",
      "If the prayer is done in this way, not just a ritual prayer but the prayer of the broken hearts, the prayer for repentant people then this will bring the mercy of Allah. And Allah will say to His servants, I have forgiven you and He will change the condition from misery to prosperity",
      "prosperity and happiness. Wonderful is the way of the believer when he is happy situation, he's thankful to Allah and when he's in difficult situation, his patient humble and ask Allah to bless and forgive May Allah SWT forgive us, may Allah have mercy upon us",
      "May Allah make us better people to ourselves, to our families, to communities, to neighbors, all the people we associate with, those who are under our authority and all the peoples of the world because the whole humanity is in one family. Allah created all people from one male and female Adam and Eve",
      "and we are all children of Adam and Eve so we are brothers and sisters and you must take care of each other BarakAllahu feekum I pray to Allah SWT bless all of you and remove this affliction from us Wa Akhiru Dha'wana Anil Hamdulillahi Rabbil Alameen Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh"

      "and keep you in good health and fulfill your desire and your aspiration and your intention inshallah perform the hajj and make this haj, hajjan maqboolan mabrooran insha'Allah wa saiyyan mashkoolan Haj that is acceptable to Allah SWT as a blessed Haj will remove the sins",
      "clean and pure like the day you were born. Hajj, we are talking about not only the rules of hajj but we are also talking about the purpose of hajdj, the spirituality of hajm. Haj as you know is one of the pillars of Islam it is the fifth Rukun Arkan al-Islam",
      "May Allah give Jannah to those who perform the Hajj and Insha'Allah keep them in good health.",
      "has rules and regulations, things are halal and things that are considered haram. So it's a complete way of life, it covers every aspect of life our personal life, our social life or family life, economic life, political life any aspect of human life that you can think of",
      "ethics and morals are given to us about that. So Hajj is among the Ibadat, a very unique Ibadah. Ibadh requires of course your heart, your intention but also your physical action and also certain financial obligations that come with it. Some Ibadats they have no",
      "obligations you don't have to pay anything and perform the Ibadah such as your Salat. When the time of Salat comes wherever you are, you perform the Salat so here is your intention your heart your mind and your physical aspect and you have Qiyam, Rukoo'a and Sujood",
      "position lying in your bed you can do that so all of these things are because it is done five times a day. In a similar way Siyam fasting does not cost any money, you have to stop eating early morning and continue until the evening time",
      "some other days if you want to do even Navafil fasting, you can do that. So fasting has a physical action as well as of course the spiritual action but there are no financial obligations. As far as Zakat is concerned, Zakat all financial. If you have money and that money has reached the Nisab then",
      "and there are a lot of details for that. So this is the financial Ibadah, Ibadat in your money, Ibaadah in your wealth but then Hajj, Hajj is both actually it's all of that it's your heart, your mind, your soul, your body as well as you spend some money",
      "has financial means enough to pay for his way, her way and all the expenses then Hajj becomes obligatory upon that person but also it has physical capability that is you are capable to perform this journey and go through all that rituals there Tawaf and Sa'i and go to Arafat",
      "it is the physical activities that are there so physical financial spiritual all of them are combined in Hajj and some people say that it is a culmination of all the Ibadat because you have Salah, you have Siyam and you have Zakat and then you have Hajj. So in Salah you turn to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala pray to Allah",
      "In Siyam, you abstain from certain things. In Hajj also you abstained from certain thing when you put on Ihram, there is some kind of abstention also in Hajj and then of course in Zakat you spend money, in Hajju you spend Money so Hajj is culmination, Hajj includes everything and that is the beauty of Hajj",
      "aspect that you can think of our Ibadat are sacred acts done at sacred time and sacred places. Every every Ibadah has certain sacred act the acts that are given to us, we are told that we should perform those deeds so you make wudu for your Salat",
      "stand up, you make qiyam, ruku' and sujood. So these acts are we are told that these are the blessed acts when you do that, stand before Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala with full intention and recite something from the Quran and you're going to ruku', and you say Subhānrabbī al-'Azim and you go into sujud and you said Subhánrabbi al-'Ālā. All of these things you do there so",
      "very blessed acts, the acts that involve our heart and mind and soul. And for Salat you can do it at any place of course for Jama'a you go to the Masjid or you can use Jama'ah in anyplace but massages are there so these are sacred places and there are certain times given to us for Salats that we do it in the morning, afternoon, early afternoon",
      "evening and night so all these are your five prayer times that are given to us. So you have sacred acts, sacred times and sacred places but for Salat you can perform it any place the Prophet said, The whole earth is a masjid for me so wherever the time comes you",
      "spiritual act and it is done at a special time. The month of Ramadan is a special, very blessed month so that is the time but again there is no place required wherever you are you fast so fasting has is a",
      "has no place, no time. It is a financial obligation you do it once a year some people do it in Ramadan the people can do it any other time your own financial air and on the basis of that you give your zakat when you come to Hajj you have all the three spiritual acts done in a special time and also done in",
      "Hajj cannot be done in any other place except some places that are given to us and those are you perform it in Mecca, you perform the Tawaf, you can perform the Sa'i and then also you go to Muzdalifah and Mina and Arafat all of these are the places that",
      "then umrah you can do it anytime but hajj requires a time, a specific time. If somebody is not there on the ninth of Hajjah then there's no Hajj, Al-Hajju Arafa. One has to be there at a particular time and the days before and the day after in different ways the rules that are",
      "of Hajj is it is a sacred act at sacred place, at sacred time. That is the speciality of Hajji that is the uniqueness of Hajjis. One should keep this in mind that I am here performing these acts but I cannot perform those acts any other place except there where Allah sent me and Allah made it possible for me to go there",
      "Allah says in the Quran, that is... And Allah SWT says this is the first house that was established for mankind. And it is important that people should visit that house. If you can afford it, if you are financially capable, physically",
      "physically capable, then you perform the Hajj. So Hajji is when a person who performs Hajj says thank Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala that he gave me enough means and he made me give me good health so I'm able to visit these places and you perform those acts with sincerity of your heart here we come to a point that ibadah as you mentioned before ibadat is an act",
      "act and ibadah also have the intention. The acts alone will not have that meaning unless there is a proper intention so we call it manasik and maqasid. Manasik are the rituals, it is the plural of mansak or the ritual",
      "a lot about the fiqh of Hajj, these are the manasik al-Hajj but also understand there are maqasid of Haj. Objectives of Haj and these objectives have to be kept in our mind why we are there what is the purpose of my being and coming in that place? What is my intention because his intention must be pure and clean",
      "sha'ir and mashaa'ira. Sha'ir are those places you visit them. وَمَن يُعْزِّمْ شَاعِرَ اللَّهَ فَإِنَّهٰ مِن تَقْوَى الْقُلُوبِ Those who honor the sacred places of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, it is because of the Taqwa of their hearts. So sha'ira there but then also when you go to the sha'iir with mashaa-ira,",
      "with your feelings, with your heart, with you soul and mind. And go away with the sincerity of the heart. Once you perform Hajj in that way it will have effect on you. It will cleanse you, purify you, make you a better person. So Hajj is all the Ibadat but especially Hajj one has to keep in mind what are my objectives?",
      "but I have come first. Now, when you come to the Manasik as the Prophet said Khudu Ani Manasikaakum Take from me your Manasic that with every detail of Hajj you are trying to find out how the Prophet performed the Hajj and the Fuqaha have gone through that and they explain that in great detail",
      "In a similar way as Salat, the Prophet said, Pray as you have seen me praying. So people observe the Salah of the Prophet and they have given us the details and our Fuqaha has elaborated that so we try to make our Salah",
      "as much as we can, as much it is possible for us. And the best Salat was the Salat of Rasulullah ﷺ So follow that way. In a similar way he said when he performed the Hajj He said خضو عني مناصقكم Take from me the way you should perform your Hajj These are Manasik Observe the rules Know what is Fard know what is Sunnah know what Nafl",
      "know what is halal, what is haram, what will make your hajj valid and invalid. And where you have to make the kaffarah. All those other details are important to know that. But all of these things should be done through understanding the maqsad of Hajj. What is the ma'qsd? What is objective? That involves niyah.",
      "that involves Niyat, your intention. The intention must be for the sake of Allah. That is with sincerity, ikhlas, total devotion without being distracted by the malls and shopping and this and that although those things are there but at the same time your intention is not that",
      "You have not gone there to visit the malls and shopping centers. You are not there to spend your time just gossiping and talking to other people, you're there to do the Ibadah. So devote yourself to Ibadat and only for the sake of Allah, not for any other thing.",
      "sincerity is very important. The other thing is continuously do the tawbah and istighfar that is the best place to do that ask Allah SWT to forgive you, forgive your sins of omission or commission if you did things that you are not supposed to do and if you",
      "sins and one should be conscious of that. And ask Allah SWT to forgive.",
      "forgive. So this is Tauba, it's Taqfar asking Allah SWT to forgive us and if we have done anything wrong to anybody else other human beings then the way of Muslims here that before they go to Hajj they ask other people to forgive them. If they owe anything to somebody they try to pay it off.",
      "someone they return the aman or to tell them how it is going to be given back in case he could forget that when not one is not back so all of these things have to be kept in mind to keep your head good clean and pure and the intention is good. The other thing is",
      "Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Ibadah is to become the servant of Allah. Our Prophet used to pray a lot, he used to make dua a lot and when his wife asked him why do you do that all this? You are the messenger of Allah! You're the best person no sins on you. Why you do it all that? He said should",
      "Should I not be a grateful servant of Allah? So that's the purpose of our ibadah, to show gratitude to Allah. You should do that for every ibadat. When we come to Salat, why are you going to Salats? One thing is it obligatory. I have to perform the Salat. The other thing is yes, it is obligatory but I am coming to Salah because I'm thankful to Allah",
      "أنا شكراً لله سبحانه وتعالى لفضله الذي أعطاه لي. أنه أعيشني حياتي وأعطاني مصادر ومساعدتي وأعياشي وأحياءي، وقد أعيدني الكثير من الأشياء. فإذا كنت أتبعها لا يمكنني تخلي عنها. لذلك أنا شكرًا لله. أطلب من الله أن يعبدني. وأن أعيني أكثر منه. إذا أعجبكم بأمركم، سوف أعبركم أكبر.",
      "you more so this is the gratitude to allah and to say that i am going to be the servant of allah always well even being the servant but there are some people who know that and some people do not know that some people will pay their time on that some",
      "spiritually, morally, individually and collectively. So monastic and Maqasid if both are done in the right way they will bring their effect on the personality. They will change the personality so my brothers and sisters let us always keep in our mind that do not do the ritual just for the sake of a ritual. The ritual has no meaning",
      "meaning. The ritual has to be done with the proper intention. Laysal birra an tuwallu wujuhakum qibal al-mashriqa wal maghrib. Righteousness is not that you turn your face this way or that way, the righteousness is not how you stand and bow and prostrate. The righteousness is that you have your iman in Allah SWT, you have commitment to Allah, ikhlās,",
      "intention. So very, very important. Manasik with Maqasid. Maqsid must be kept in our mind and then there is another aspect of Hajj which is a unique aspect of hajj that is haj is actually all our Ibadat are that way but Hajj is much more than any other",
      "and the vertical aspect. So Hajj has a vertical aspect, and Hajj also has a horizontal aspect. The vertical aspect is our connection with Allah that is it connects us with our Creator. These sacred acts that we do they are to bring your relationship between you and Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala",
      "and by following the way of his prophets Ibrahim, Ismail, Muhammad So this is the connection between you and heaven. That is very important, and that must remain always in our consciousness because when we stand in our prayers",
      "I am turning my face towards Him who created the heaven and earth, without any deviation. I'm not a mushrik. I am bringing no one in association with Allah SWT in my act of worship.\" So that is the vertical dimension",
      "and this vertical dimension is very, very important. But there is another benefit in Hajj, although in other ibadat also you have it when you go to the masjid and do the jama' prayer, you have some horizontal aspect, horizontal dimensions that you stand next to your brothers or sisters, with brothers and sisters, but they are there in the masjed so you are there with other Muslims. Now in Haj",
      "In Hajj, the dimension is much more broad and bigger. So here you have people from all over the world. And this is a very important aspect of Hajj. It brings the people together. Salat brings the localities together. Jummah prayer brings the larger locality people come together. Eid prayer bring maybe the people of the city together",
      "or people of one quarter, part of the city together. But Hajj it brings Ummah together. This is ummatic aspect. It is an aspect of the Ummah and Muslims must be conscious of that. That we are in Ummah. And this Ummah is beyond race and color and nationality.",
      "Islam is very important, Muslims must keep in their mind that we are brothers and sisters wherever they may live. Arabs, non-Arabs, whites and blacks, people of any race, any color, any ethnicity, they all say La ilaha illallah Muhammad Rasulullah so they are our brothers and",
      "Here we see that. And that means people must be concerned about others. When somebody has his mourning and her mourning, and has no care or concern with others, it doesn't belong to those Muslims. It is important that people should be concerned",
      "So Hajj reinforces that, Hajj builds that universal brotherhood of Islam and that is the horizontal aspect of Hajj. Horizontal dimension of Hajji. So when we go there, you see Muslims of diverse races, colors languages and cultures and we'll see Muslims",
      "have Hanafis, Shafraeids, Malikis, Hanbanis and other different groups or schools of thought you will see that. You see Muslims of different socio-economic background some of them are very rich and some of the more poor and some in between so you'll see that you will",
      "Some of them are highly educated, highly sophisticated and some of them not. So you will see that because the Ummah is represented there. Muslims have various political views and Muslims have different spiritual levels, different religious understandings. This is how the Ummas are.",
      "and we have to know people, appreciate what we have whatever shortcomings we have try to see how we can correct them how you can make this Ummah a better Ummah. And this is very important aspect of Hajj and at the same time it is of course our connection with Allah The more our connection is Allah the stronger our Iman the stronger will be our Brotherhood",
      "brotherhood and the better our Iman, the better will be our Brotherhood. The more our Imaan, the more it'll be our brotherhood. And the more the Imaan of the people, the larger will be the Ummah inshaAllah. So we try to increase that so when you come back from Hajj, we are filled with Imaan",
      "and understanding of each other. That is what the uniqueness of Hajj is. I pray to Allah SWT that He gives us the spirit of Haj, we perform Hajj, its rituals in the right way, and then at the same time receive its meaning, its purpose because there are two things that are required. One is Ikhlas, the other is Salah.",
      "Ikhlas is the sincerity and Salah is the right way of doing it. That you do the way that Prophet has told, and the way prescribed in the Quran and Sunnah of the Prophet but at the same time with the sincerity of the heart.",
      "We have a few questions inshallah. If you don't mind, I can begin asking the questions. Okay. The first question is since Ihram is taken off after shaving hair, is Tawaf performed with Ihram on or with normal clothes? I'm not quite sure if this is the tawaful qudoom or tawaul efada but if you'd like Sheikh to answer it. I know that it's part of the fiqh of Hajj. It's up to you inshAllah.",
      "Yes, Ihram is important but it is for certain tawaf. Not every tawf requires ihram When you go there with the intention of umrah Then your first tawaff will be with ihram And that means going seven times around the Kaaba in ihram and then you perform the sa'i in ihrum so that is the requirement after that",
      "perform your Umrah, you are out of Ihram with trimming your hair or shaving the head. Then once then once you are OUT OF ihram, you're in regular clothes, then you perform Tawaf as many times as you can, as many time as you want and there is no requirement for any ihram for that. In a similar way when you come back from",
      "from you perform your, go to Arafah. You are in Mina and then you come for your Tawaf of Hajj. And this Tawaff of Haj, if you have cut your hairs in Mina, and you perform a sacrifice, you're on your regular clothes. You do that Tawaph in your regular cloths. Even you do your sign with your regular",
      "At that time. So these are some more details of that, but the point is that not every thought requires a harm Doctor and of course we'll cover these in the thick of Hodge sessions in the next coming months with me I believe these are two questions dr. Siddiqui and they follow each other so I'm going to ask them both together There's a participant asking are we allowed to use umbrellas during Amra and hatched off? That's one",
      "And I believe a follow-up question is can we use an umbrella hat during Ihram? So maybe those are two connected questions.",
      "to cover their head when they are in Ihram. Otherwise, they can sit under shade and they can have the umbrella to have the shade. They can be on the bus. There is one school of thought in which they say that you should not wear an umbrella and it should not be... The bus should not",
      "Jafari school of thought but that's not the according to Hanafi school Maliki Shafa and others that it is not required. Jazakallah Khair doctor so basically what you're saying is we can I'm sorry doctor? Ahmed, you had some other question, second question over there",
      "question over there yes the second question was i believe if you can wear an umbrella hat i believe it ties down uh i think there's a strap to your head and then it like it's elevated an umbrella that touch is pretty much touching there's something that's touching your head is that allowed why same thing but they're known there's no prohibition of using umbrella",
      "As an umbrella like basically it's kind of like a hat that becomes an umbrella. What is that permitted? And if head Correct, yes No, no, if it is if you're covering your head then no it is not it's not allowed during I don't know why Okay very good",
      "is that some area was left out and there is now a circle on the side. There is Hajr Aswad, and then after that when you go further, then you will see the Hatim area. That is known also as Hijri Ismail.",
      "This is also a question I believe that may have logistical and religious responses. So, I'll ask it then maybe I'll explain. The question is in the first webinar, the brother said to his sister that they will assign a mihram if you don't have one but mihrum is defined by the Sharia so how can you assign a Mihram to a woman? So,I believe the question is... I believe the Sheikh that answered the question was to a sister who's over the age of 45",
      "and they're asking if they can travel without a mihram so they are permitted to go without a mahram I think that's more of a logistical Saudi government rule versus the question of how you can assign a mehrem to a woman Mahram is a person who to whom the woman cannot marry",
      "companion but beside that his son, brother nephew so these are the people who are known as Muharrim and a woman can travel with them now if those are not there and a women who is 45 or 50 year old according to their rules",
      "And then they require that she is in the company of other ladies. And those ladies, they are not mahram but at least they are together so there's a group there and because of the group, she can go. So there's permission that a woman can travel with the group because the purpose is safety and security",
      "she can perform the Hajj and Umrah in the company of those people. But younger ladies who have no mahram, it is better that they do not travel by themselves unless the mahrum is with them. JazakAllah khair doctor I believe we have approximately three more questions and then we can wrap up the session inshallah. The next question is a",
      "Please ask Dr. Siddiqui what dua to use to ask forgiveness and if there is any dua book that we need to obtain before Hajj? So the question is, what is a specific dua for forgiveness and what dua book do you recommend doctor, if they would like to obtain one? We'll be providing them Husn al-Muslim as well.",
      "You should repeat that. It doesn't require any book. There are many du'as of istighfar, so those du'a's you can say that they're books explaining Hajj and towards the end they mention many duaa",
      "The best dua is subhanAllahi wa alhamdulillah, la ilaha illa Allah allahu akbar. You repeat that or you say rabbanatina fi dunya hasana wafil aakhirati hasana wa qinAAadab an-naar These are short duas of stighfar and then other books explaining the Hajj they also contain many duas",
      "Jazakallah Khair Doctor. I believe this next question is...",
      "any difficulties. Okay, another question is I believe this is a mechanical fickle question but hopefully if you don't mind Shaykh if we can answer it doctor the question is as I know there are restrictions with regards to Ihram that you cannot have stitches does the same rule apply on sandals shoes and belts?",
      "what what i should not have so the question is about stitching. Stitching is restricted to the actual ihram but does it apply to sandals shoes and belts? I mean stitch itself is not the prohibition, the issue is that something is not your clothes are not fitting your body that's",
      "as shoes are concerned they also have this so there's nothing wrong in wearing your shoes sandals or having a belt that has stitches that is not a clothes that is",
      "on the carry-on bag that you have, stitches on your shoes or slippers. Those things are not prohibited. Understood. Last question doctor is a participant asking what is the difference between different programs like program two three four five and six and which one can perform? If I may",
      "If I may, can I answer it from a logistical question and then if you'd like to add something? Yeah. That's logistic as well. You have to mention that. Okay. So basically... Sharia is concerned there is no program one into it. Yes. So I believe the question is what's the difference between the programs just simply. We have them on the website. We've had other sessions with regards to the logistics and how to choose a program but",
      "four, five and six each one of them is numbered based on itinerary. So for instance program two, program four, program five, program six they all start in Medina first and then they go and stay in Mecca and then the go for Hajj while program three begins in Meccan for a few days before Hajj so I think the question that the participant is asking is the differences of what you can perform? For instance program 2 goes to",
      "of Dhul Hijjah in Ihram for Umrah but I believe program two can essentially do, program 2 and program 6 because they go to Medina and they come on the 7th or 8th of Dhull Hijjaj. They can essentially Hajj Kiran and Hajj Tamattu' if i'm not mistaken doctor if they arrive on the seventh of Dhool Hijja or eighth of Dhual Hijja in Mecca versus program three is there for four days so ideally they would do Hajj",
      "well will be in Mecca four days prior to Hajj so I would assume they would do Hajj, Tamattu as well. Would you like to add anything doctor? Well the people should know the difference between different types of Hajj. Hajj Ifrat, Hajj Tamattut or Hajj Qiraan. Somebody who only makes Hajj does not make Umrah that's one category called Ifrat and somebody",
      "after that take off the ihram and when put on the regular clothes, in a regular situation. And then after the time of Hajj comes they put on ihram for Hajj, that's called tamattor. Somebody will have ihram from Umrah and Hajj together. So one ihram, and then after that they perform umrah and continue, don't take off their ihram until Hajj time.",
      "eighth of Dhul-Hajjah, they will not have any time to take off their Ihram and be in the regular clothes. Because on the 8th of Dhull-Hujjah normally everybody put on ihram to go to Mina. So that's why if somebody going from Madinah on the 7th or 8th Dhul Hajjah the best thing for them is to do the intention of Quran,",
      "Jazakum Allah Khair Doctor. One last question and we'll conclude, bi-idhnillah",
      "As far as Dua is concerned, I believe one can ask Allah in their own language if any Quranic Dua preferred is not remembered. Is that correct?",
      "for your friends, anybody who asks you to make dua and use any language because we use the Arabic language for duas only because we have certain duas of the Quran and the Sunnah. And those duas that are mentioned in the Quran or Sunnah, we use them in Arabic because these are words of Allah and the words of Prophet. But other duas",
      "the beautiful dua in other languages as well. JazakAllah Khair Doctor, I really appreciate it thank you so much for your time if you don't mind Shaykh Doctor if you could kindly close the session with Dua and we'll end it with Ibnillah May Allah bless you Jazakallah khair",
      "وعزائم مغفرتك والغنيمة من كل بر والسلامة من كل اسم الفوضى بالجنة والنجاة من النار اللهم أصلحنا وأصلح أحوالنا اللهم يا حي يا قيوم يا قدوس يا رب السماوات والأرض يا ذا الجلال والإكرام نسألك علما نافعا وقلبا خاشعا ولصقا واسعا لسانا ذاكرة وتوبة قبل الموت وراحة عند الموت والعفو عن النفساء والفوض بالجناة والتجاهة من"

Regardless whether the people of your race or another race, of your color or another color, of nationality or another nationality, I mean if you are religion or another religion all human beings should be treated with respect. All human being should be treat with goodness and kindness",
      "In the modern time, the term for that is used as pluralism. And it is something, a word that has become very common, commonly used. We say America is a pluralistic society and so it is important to understand pluralism and how we as Muslims relate to that.",
      "means that people live interact with each other coexist have relations regardless of races and colors and nationalities and religions so that's what the plurality means that different backgrounds live together they say that pluralism is different from diversity diversity is just to recognize that we are diverse",
      "But diversity does not mean interaction, relationship. Just recognizing this the different people are living but interaction working together relating to each other that is called pluralism. Then there people say pluralism is different from tolerance. Tolerance is a great thing it's a great virtue",
      "but then it is said tolerance means that you are enduring someone like you endure like your tolerate a bitter medicine so people say tolerance could mean yeah I mean I don't like what I endure him I mean that's I don' have any dealing with yes okay living next to me",

Recently I attended a few conferences, that was the subject, that were the questions raised.

      "As-salamu alaykum everyone. Welcome to our Friday program we're going to start off with the recitation of Surah Al Kahaf by Zian Ibrahim followed by the Jummah message by Dr Mazamul Siddiqui, last few days of Ramadan some reflections and reminders. Brother Zian you can get started okay",
      "أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الحمد لله الذي أنزل على عبده الكتاب ولم يجعل له معوجا قيما لينفر بأسا شديدا",
      "ويبشر المؤمنين الذين يعملون الصالحات أن لهم أجرا حسنا ماكثين فيه أبدا وينذر الذين قالوا اتخذ الله ولدا",
      "كبرت كلمة تخرج من أفواههم إن يقولون إلا كذبا فلعلك باخع نفسك على آثارهم إن لم يؤمنوا بهذا الحديث أسفا",
      "لنبلوهم أيهم أحسن عملا وإنا لجاعلون ما عليها صعيدا جرزا أم حسبت أن أصحاب الكهف والرقيم كانوا من آياتنا عجبا",
      "فقالوا ربنا آتنا من لدنك رحمة وهيئ لنا من أمرنا رشدا فضربنا على آذانهم في الكهف سنين عددا ثم بعثناهم لنعلم أي الحزبين أحصى لما نبثون",
      "نحن نقص عليك نبأهم بالحق إنهم فتية آمنوا بربهم وزدناهم هدا",
      "لقد قلنا إذا شقطا هؤلاء قوم نتخذ من دونه آلهة لو لا يأتون عليهم بسلطان بين فمن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا وإذ اعتزلتموهم وما يعبدون",
      "وما يعبدون إلا الله فأهوا إلى الكهف ينشر لكم ربكم من رحمته ويهيئ لكم من أمركم مرفقا",
      "وإذا غربت تقرضهم ذات الشمال وهم في فجوة منه ذلك من آيات الله من يهدي الله فهو المهتد ومن يضلل فلن تجد له وليا مرشدا",
      "قال قائل منهم كم لبثتم قالوا لبسنا يوما أو بعض يوم قالوا ربكم أعلم بما لبستم فبعثوا أحدكم بورقكم هذه إلى المدينة",
      "فليأتكم برزق منه وليتلطف ولا يشعرن بكم أحدا إنهم إن يظهروا عليكم يرجموكم أو يعيدوكم في ملتهم ولن تفلحوا إذاً أبدا",
      "وعلموا أن وعد الله حق وأن الساعة لا ريب فيها إذ يتنازعون بينهم أمرهم فقالوا بنوا عليهم بنيانا ربهم أعلم بهم قال الذين غلبوا على أمره لنتخذن عليهم مسجدا",
      "سيقولون ثلاثة رابعهم كلبهم ويقولن خمسة سادسهم كلبحم رجما بالغيب",
      "إلا مراءا ظاهرا ولا تستفت فيهم منهم أحدا ولا تقولن لشيء إني فاعل ذلك غدا إلا أن يشاء الله",
      "ولبثوا في كهفهم ثلاثمائة سنين وازدادوا تسعا قل الله أعلم بما لبثوه له غير السماوات والأرض أبصر به وأسمع ما لهم من دون إيمي ولي ولا يشرك في حكمه أحدا",
      "واتل ما أوحي إليك من كتاب ربك لا مبدن لكلماته ولن تجد من دونه ملتحدا",
      "وقل الحق من ربكم فمن شاء فليؤمن ومن شائف ليكفر",
      "وإن يستغيثوا يغاثوا بماء كالمهل يشوي الوجوه بئس الشراب وساءت مرتفقا إن الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات إنا لا نضيع أجر من أحسن عملا",
      "أولئك لهم جنات عدل تجري من تحتهم الأنهار يحلون فيها من أساور من ذهب ويلبسون ثيابا خطرا من سندس واستبرق متكئين فيها على الأرائك",
      "نعم الثواب وحسنة مرتفقا واضرب لهم مثل الرجلين جعلنا لأحدهما جنتين من أعناب و حفثناهما بنخل وجعلنا بينهما زرعا",
      "وكان له ثمر فقال لصاحبه وهو يحاوره أنا أكثر من كمان وأعز نفرا",
      "أظن الساعة قائمة وليردت إلى ربي لأجدن خير منها موقلبا قال له صاحبه وهو يحاوره أكفرت بالذي خلقك من تراب ثم من نطفة ثم سواك رجلا",
      "لكن هو الله ربي ولا أشرك بربي أحدا ولولا إذ دخلت جنتك قلت ما شاء الله لا قوة إلا بالله إن ترني أنا كل من كمالا وولدا",
      "ويُرسل عليها حسبانا من السماء فتصبح صعيدا زلقا أو يصبح ماءها غورا فلن تستطيع لهم طلبا",
      "فأصبح يطلب كفيه على ما أنفق فيها وهي خاوية على عروشها ويقول يا ليتني لم أشرك بربي أحدا ولم تكن له فئة ينصرونه من دون الله وما كان منتصرا",
      "وكان الله على كل شيء مقتدرا المال والبنون زينة الحياة الدنيا والباقيات الصالحات خير عند ربك ثوابا وخير أملا",
      "وعرضوا على ربك صفا لقد جئتمونا كما خلقناكم أول مرة بل زعمتم أن لن نجعل لكم موعدا",
      "لهذا الكتاب لا يغادر صغيرة ولا كبيرة إلا أحصاها ووجدوا ما عملوا حاضرا ولا يظلم ربك أحدا وإذ قلنا للملائكة اسجدون آدم فسجدوا إن لا إبريس كان من الجن ففسق عن أمر ربه",
      "أفتتخذونه وذريته أولياء من دوني وهم لكم عجوب بئس للظالمين بدلا ما أشهدتهم خلق السماوات والأرض ولا خلقة أنفسهم",
      "ويخذ المضلين عبداً ويوم يقولوا نادوا شركائي الذين زعمتم فدعوهم فلم يستجيبوا لهم وجعلنا بينهم موبقاً",
      "ولقد صرفنا في هذا القرآن للناس من كل مثل وكان الإنسان أكثر شيء جدلا",
      "إلا أن تأتيهم سنة الأولين أو يأتيه العذاب قبلا وما نرسل المرسنين إلا مبشرين ومنذرين ويجادل الذين كفروا بالباطن يدحضوا به الحق واتخذوا آياتي وما أنذروا هزوى",
      "ومن أظلم مما ذكر بآيات ربه فأعرض عنها ونسيا ما قدمت يدا إنا جعلنا على قلوبهم أكنة أن يفقهوه وفي آذانهم وقرا",
      "وربك الغفور ذو الرحمة لو يآخذوهم بما كسبوا لعجل لهم العذاب بل لكم موعد لن يجدوا من دونه موئلا وتلك القرى أهلكناهم لما ظلموا وجعلنا لمهدكهم موحدا",
      "وإذ قال موسى لفتاه لا أبرح حتى أبلغ مجمع البحرين أو أنضي حقبا فلما بلغ م جمع بينهما نسيا حوتهما فاتخذ سبيله في البحري ثربا",
      "قال أرأيت إذ أوينا إلى الصخرة فإني نسيت الحوت وما أنسانيه إلا الشيطان أن أذكره",
      "فوجد عبدا من عبادنا آتيناه رحمة من عندنا وعلمناه من لدنا علما قال له موسى هل أتبعك على أن تعلمني منك",
      "قال إنك لن تستطيع معي صبرا وكيف تصبر على ما لم تحق به خبرا قال ستجدني إن شاء الله صابرا ولا أعصي لك أمرا",
      "فلا تسألني عن شيء حتى أحدث لك منه ذكرى. فانطلقا حتى إذا ركبا في السفينة خرقها. قال أخرقتها لتغرق أهلها لقد جئت شيئا إمرا. قال أنم أقول لك إنك لن تستطيع معي صبرا.",
      "قال لا تآخذني بما نسيت ولا ترهقني من أمري عسرا فانطلقا حتى إذا لقي غلاما فقتله قال أقتلت نفسا زكية بغير نفس",
      "لقد جئت شيئا نكرا قال ألم أقلك إنك لن تستطيع معي صبرا قال إن سألتك عن شيء بعدها فلا تصاحبني قد بلغت من لدني عذرا",
      "أهل قرية استطعما أهنها فأبوا أن يضيفوهما فوجدا فيها جدارا يريد أن ينقض فأقام قال لو شت لاتخذت عليه أجرا قال هذا فراق بيني وبينك سأنبئك بتأويل ما لم تستطع عليه صبرا",
      "أما السفينة فكانت لمساكين يعملون في البحر فأردت أن أعيبها وكان وراءهم ملك يأخذ كل سفينته غصبا وأما الغلام فكان أمواه مؤمنين فخشينا أن يرهقهما طول",
      "فأردنا أن يبدنهما ربهما خيرا منه زكاة وأقرب رحما",
      "ويستخرج كنزهما رحمة من ربك وما فعلته عن أمري ذلك تأويذ ما لم تستع عليه صبرا",
      "قل سأتنو عليكم منه ذكرا إنا مكن كل شيء سببا فأتبع سبابا حتى إذا بلغ مغرب الشمس وجدها تغرب في عين حميئة",
      "ووجد عندها قوما قلنا يا ذا القرن وإما أن تتخذ فيهم حسنا قال أما من ظلم فسوف نعذبه ثم يرد إلى ربه فيعذبح عذابا مكرا",
      "فله جزاء الحسنى وسنقول له من أمرنا يسرا ثم نحن ستعلم من دونها سفرا كذلك وقد أحطنا بما لديه خبرا",
      "أتبع سببا حتى إذا بلغ بين السدين وجد من دونهما قوما لا يكادون يفقهون قولا قالوا يا ذا القرنين إن",
      "We apologize we're having some audio difficulties. Let's, well just wait a second for Brother Zian to reconnect. Hello? Yes, we can hear you.",
      "Yes, we can hear you again. Brother Zian?",
      "حتى إذا جعله نارا قال آتوني أفرغ عليه قطرا فما استطاعوا أن يظهروه وما است طاعوا له نقبا",
      "وكان وعد ربي حقا وتركنا بعضهم يومئذ يموج في بعض ونفخ في الصور فجمعناهم جمعا واعرضنا جهنم يومي ذي للكافرين عرضا",
      "وكانوا لا يستطيعون سماعا أفحسب الذين كفروا أن يتخذوا عبادي من دوني أوليا إنا أعتدنا جهنم للكافرين نزلا قل هل ننبئكم بالأخسرين أعمالا",
      "الذين ضل سعيهم في الحياة الدنيا وهم يحسبون أنهم يُحسنون صنعا أولئك الذين كفروا بآيات ربهم ولقائه فحبطت أعمالهم فلا نقيم لهم يوم القيامة وزنا ذلك جزاؤهم جهنم",
      "ويذنب بما كفروا واتخذوا آياتي ورسلي هزوى إن الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات كانت لهم جناة في اردوس نزلا خالدين فيها لا يبرون عنها حولا",
      "لنفد البحر قبل أن تنفذ كلمات ربي ولو جئنا بمثله مددا",
      "فمن كان يرجو نقاء ربه فليعمل عملا صالحا ولا يشرك بعبادة رب أحدا",

      "Alhamdulillah, as-salatu wa-salaamu ala rasoolillah, wa'ala alihi wa sahbihi man wala. Wa bi shahli sadri wa yassirli amri, wa hlul uqdatan min lisani yaqahu qawli. All praise is Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala, the Lord of the worlds, and peace and blessings upon his prophets and messengers. Ya ayyuhal ladhina amin uttaqullah katukatih.",
      "Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala addresses the believers that they must always remain conscious of Allah, be mindful of Allah. Be obedient to Allah",
      "and live their whole life until the end as Muslims, those who submit to Allah. And believers also be mindful of Allah and say right words good words. Alhamdulillah we thank Allah that He gave us the blessed month of Ramadan",
      "spite of all the difficulties that the world is facing because of this coronavirus but alhamdulillah we were able to fast. We were at our homes, you could not be at the masjid but even at home alhamdullilah we thank Allah SWT that you are there with our families and able to pray and fast and do the dhikr of Allah SWt and do",
      "May Allah accept, may Allah remove this difficulty, this virus from the face of the earth and make all humanity that is going through all these difficulties, may allah remove our difficulties. We are now in the last few days after blessed month of Ramadan",
      "Eid is expected inshallah on the 24th of May, on Sunday the 24 th of May. So these last few days are the peak of the month of Ramadan. It is a month of grace, it is a",
      "Because when you do something strenuous for several weeks, toward the end you become slow. Toward the end, you feel exhausted and tired. But the believers in the month of Ramadan, when the month comes towards the end they become more active. Their enthusiasm grows. The Hadith of the Prophet says,",
      "used to tighten his belt and uh used to keep the knights awake the whole night he was for the week praying and doing the dhikr of allah and also awakenings family members they",
      "I afford in Awadh because these are very, very precious days. And one of the nights of this day or this last Ashra, last 10th, one of these nights could be the night of Khandro, a precious night, a night that is better than 1,000 months. So we should pay more attention to this time. We thank Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala",
      "for all his blessings we thank for the whole month of Ramadan and Alhamdulillah Allah gave us health and tawfiq and hidayah you know, the guidance that we are able to fast. And those who were not well because of their sickness or something could not fast may Allah forgive them may Allah give them health inshaAllah but those of us who have been",
      "We are very thankful to Allah for that. In Surah Al-Ra'd, Allah says those who believe and their hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. And behold",
      "in the remembrance of Allah, the hearts find comfort. So those who believe and do good deeds for them is good news. Good news for them be happy let them be because their return will be in the right place. Their coming home will be wonderful inshaAllah",
      "So hearts find comfort. The time is very uncomfortable, the situation is not that good but because you remember Allah, because you believe in Allah and because you do the good deeds, Allah will give you the comfort. Allah will",
      "So my brothers and sisters, if you have worries, difficulties, anxieties do the dhikr of Allah. Remember Allah, follow the right path and we will do good things. And this is a great time now to make dua. This is a",
      "Connect yourself with Allah. Come close to Allah by your good deeds. So increase your ibadah, increase your salat, your nawafil, increase you tilawatul Qur'an, increase",
      "ask him to bless you bless your family remove the worries and difficulties and anxieties from you from your family and from the whole world and this is also the time to give the sadaqat the charity to help the poor and the needy to help",
      "cause of Allah. It is the time to give your zakat if you have not done that yet, a lot of people wait until almost towards the end of Ramadan to pay their zakah so give your zakaat and your reward will be plenty, your reward would be multiplied many times. Give sadaqa tul fitr before they eat prayer,",
      "Rasulullah made it obligatory upon the believers and every person who has enough food, enough means for himself and his family he should give Sadaqat al-Fitr for the poor and the needy. So that poor and needy people during these days especially on Eid day they are not deprived. They get food for themselves and their families",
      "And the estimate was, I mean it is one saa which is about three kilo of wheat or barley or rice or dates. That was the thing that was done in the time of the Prophet, but we estimate now at its value and it's about ten dollars per person in the family. So ten dollars for a person in",
      "people, men women whatever head of the household supposed to pay that. So give your sadaqat al fitr before you pray any prayer and all of these acts of devotion these acts",
      "will bring happiness to you. Someone came to the Prophet and asked him, Messenger of Allah what is faith? And the Prophet said If your good deeds make you happy and your bad deeds make",
      "So believers find comfort and happiness, satisfaction in doing good deeds. Good deeds make them happy. It's not that anything that makes you happy is good for you. No, a good thing should make you happy. And then Prophet Muhammad says, and when you do anything bad, you should be unhappy.",
      "you say that why I did that correct yourself improve yourself repent ask forgiveness of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala if you have that attitude then you know that you have iman inside you you have faith inside you so this is the character of faith character of fate is always feel happy when you do good",
      "When you help someone, when you give some charity in the cause of Allah, you say Alhamdulillah I was able to do that. Allah SWT enabled me gave me enough that I spend upon myself and I give it to others so that is the attitude that should be the feeling of the believer now believers don't brag when they do good things",
      "I did that, I did this. Because we don't rely on our actions, on our deeds. We don't really on our prayers and our fasts or charity. We rely on the mercy of Allah. We lie in the love of Allah. We rely upon the grace of Allah So even doing all these things you feel humble",
      "feel humble and ask Allah accept it from me like Ibrahim alaihi salam and his son Ismail both of them were building their building up the Kaaba, Ibrahim was an old man and Isma'il was very young and both of they were building the Kaabah and after they finished not except from us so that's that's the attitude of the believers",
      "the believers that we fast, we pray, we give zakah and then you say Allah accept this. This is our humble effort what I'm doing it and I am not doing this because of me I'm do it because You gave me the hidayah, You gave to tawfiq, You made it possible for me to do that so thank Allah SWT and be humble before Allah",
      "I ask him to accept it from you and inshaAllah Allah will accept. And the way to know how that Allah accepted or not, that means you become...you started moving on the path of goodness. Start doing good one good after another. The reward of a good deed is a good",
      "I remind myself and I remind you the message is let us use this time very wisely and benefit from this time. Benefit for this time, for ourselves, for our Akhirah. And that we can do inshaAllah by paying attention to these nights, to these days and finish this month insha Allah and become out winners insha'Allah",
      "winners inshaAllah, blessed by this time. Ramadan brings a lot of blessings and the Prophet said in one of the hadiths mentioned that he said he is a loser, he's a loser he or she who find the month of Ramadan and does not get forgiveness from Allah so these are the moments to receive the forgiveness from allah",
      "So may Allah bless us, accept our fasts, accept prayers, accept devotion and charity. And remove the difficulties especially of coronavirus from us and humanity. And give us normal lives so that we return to our masajid and pray there together inshaAllah",
      "But as it stands, we will not be able to have Hrithikav in this month in the massages. And also Eid prayer you have to pray at home because big gathering is not possible. So we'll pray at Home on 24th May Insha Allah on Sunday",
      "and we are reminding everybody that do everything that you're supposed to do for Eid day get up early of course you pray Fajr prayer and then after that do the Takbirat Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar La ilaha illa Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu Akbar wa lillahil hamd and then take shower if you have not taken before Fajar take shower",
      "and put on nice garments as you do when you go out for eight prayer so do it in your home put out your good clothes and after that you can have breakfast because in eid al fitr we are supposed to have breakfast before we go before we pray so have breakfast and then after that sit down together with the family and say takbirat",
      "Repeat the takbirat. Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar La ilaha illa Allah Allahu Akbar wa li'l-hamd Make it create an atmosphere of Eid Musalla of Eids As if you are in the Eid Gah In the place of EID Imagine all those people InshaAllah in your spirit we are with them Even though there is social distance and away from others",
      "away from others, but inshaAllah our hearts are together with others. And then around nine o'clock because that's what we're expecting here from the Islamic Society of Orland County, that those of you who are connected to the Islamic society of Orland County pray at around same time. Of course, you're making your own prayer. You're not joining in any kind of virtual prayer.",
      "prayer you make your own jama'ah so pray two rak'ah with takbirat. So in the first rak'a, you start with Allahu Akbar raising your hand and then after holding them recite Subhanak Allahumma bihamdik wa tabarak asmukh wa taala jadduk wa la ilaha ghairuq and then you say seven Takbeers",
      "Allahu Akbar, put your hand down. Allahu Akbar put your hands down and after the seventh takbir hold your hand and then you decide, the Imam will decide Surah Al-Fatihah and some other surah and then do the ruku'a and sujood and when you stand up for the second rak'ah again you say five takbeers Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar five takbirs to do that",
      "and then you hold your hand after the fifth takbir, and the Imam recite Surah al-Fatiha and Salat as-Sura. And then you have ruku' and sujood and tashahud and finish your salat. After salat is finished, stay! And it is the time that we'll have a message of Eid. The khutbah will be just like to have message for Friday",
      "for friday so it will be delayed and you can hear it and inshallah that will be a message to thank allah to appreciate the time and ask his forgiveness his mercy and his grace upon all of us so this will be insha'Allah way of doing it and then after that after you finish the salah you embrace your family members children and others",
      "and exchange gifts if you want to exchange gifts have something to eat enjoy it go out and even by car you can give greetings your family member those who are not with you your friend who are Not with you even by card, you can go and give them the greeting or you can distribute some things some gifts to anyone like this or you",
      "some poor people. Whatever way you want to do it, celebrate that day inshaAllah with the goodness. So this is these are great days that are coming even though we have all the lockdown but there are many things that are still available and we are thankful to Allah for that and let's appreciate that because if you give thanks Allah will give you more so my brothers and sisters may Allah",
      "May Allah bless you. May Allah protect you. Keep us all on the right path. May allah bless our children and don't feel sad, don't fear anxiety but trust in Allah and be patient and inshaAllah this will go away and good things are going to come and good thing is going to happen that you have to be thankful to Allah for that so be patient",
      "and this is the way to live your life inshallah a happy life, a good life,",
      "and then we pray in general for everybody. So please pray for Parvez Haq, Sister Khairul Nisa Patel, Brother Muhammad Rafi, Brother Mubarak Ali, Brother Abdullah Bin Ghidara, and Brother Muhammad Ali. Pray for all those people who are working in the hospital providing health care",

      "If it is an option, you can say yeah, it is An option for us So either it is fard or it is Sunnah Or it is nafl or it Is mustahab, whatever But it is still, if it comes from Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam It has to be taken seriously To ati'u Allah and ati''u rasool Obey Allah And obey the messenger of Allah One cannot say I just Obey the Quran If somebody says I obey the Quran And does not obey the prophet",
      "He is not obeying the Quran, he's neither obeying Quran nor obeying Prophet. He is deceiving himself or deceiving others by saying that only Allah to be followed, only Quran to be follow. We follow the Quran and we follow the Sunnah of the Prophet. Of course we qualify the Sunna Quran all of this authentic there is no question about that but Sunna yes it been reported",
      "coming from the Rasulullah ﷺ. But if it is coming from Rasulallah ﷺ, فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَيُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّى يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِي مَا شَجَرًا بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا جَزَدُوا حَرْضًا مِمَّا قَضَيتُ وَيسَلِّموا تَسْلِيمًا فَلا وَ رَبّكَ And by your Lord they will not be true believers until they take their decisions to you and whatever you decide,",
      "Without any if and but in their heart. Take it. Whatever the messenger gives you, take it. Don't do it? Don't Do It! That is Ta'a of Rasulullah. Ta'aa of Allah, Ta'aaa of the Messenger of Allah. But there is something more beside Ta'aaaa. And that is Ittibaaa of Rasullallah.",
      "is following, following his footsteps. It is taking him as a role model because Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam of course he was a human being but at the same time he was the messenger of Allah. So his Bashariyah as a human beings born in the 6th-7th century of the common era lived in Arabia so there are certain things personal. There's something human",
      "the way he ate, the way sat, the camels or donkeys and the way was his home. These are all personal things you don't have to follow that. You don't say no I haven't ride camel, I don't use car. No it's not required unless he says you do it if you said do it anything personal then do it Rasulullah",
      "كان يجب أن تقف على الطابق لكي تأكل ولكنه لم يقول أنك محاولة التعرض على الطريق لتأكل. يمكنك السيطرة على الطابل ، يمكنكم السيئة على الطوابق ، يوجد طرق مختلفة للأكل ، يتمكن من الأكل ، لكن قال استخدم اليد المسيحية ، فقال ذلك ، قل بيمينك ، سمّى وقل بيومينك وقُل مما يليك ، إذا قل بالنسبة إلى الله وسلم ، وأكل بيدك اليد الحقيقية الآن هذا الإستنادم باليد الحديث هو",
      "It's the sunnah of Rasulullah ﷺ. Unless somebody has an excuse. Otherwise, it should be done that way. So we want to just eat what kind of food you want to eat. One cannot say it's haram to eat biryani because Rasulallah ﷺ never ate biryani. Yeah, you can eat biriani. You can eat anything else as long as it is halal. So it has to be halal but how it is cooked is up to you.",
      "he did as a human being and we don't have to follow that unless he tells us to do that but there are certain things that he did it at the messenger of Allah and the Prophet of Allah then you should follow him she had followed example is teaching his way of life and that it tiba will take you to Jannah that if they Bob will bring",
      "يحبون الله فاتبعوني يحبيبكم الله",
      "That is learning how the Prophet did things, how he lived, how you treated the people. That is the real Sunnah. The real Sunna is his love and kindness, mercy. We did not send you as a mercy. So being merciful to your family, to your people, to neighbors, to co-workers, to believers and nonbelievers that is the sunnah.",
      "That is the sunnah of Rasulullah ﷺ. That is way of Rasullullah ﷺ The Prophet said to one of the Sahaba, O my son if you can have your morning and evening such that you have no anger, no grudge, no hate for anyone do it",
      "وهذا هو سنةي ومن يتبعني سوف يعود معي في الجنة ما هذا المحسن أنه تتباع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم هذا التباع الذي يتابع مثاله إذن أولاً الإيمان الثانية هي الطاعة والثالثة هي التباح لكن هناك شيء أكثر من ذلك يا أخوتي وأخواتي",
      "much required and that is the love of the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam. Hub Al Rasool, Hub Al rasool salallahu alaihi wa saalam. And the hub of Rasool the love the prophet has means that Rasoolullah as a person must be dearer to you than your parent then your children then your spouses then anybody else on this world including",
      "He will be dearer to you than your own self. Say if your parents, your children, your spouses, your family,",
      "your business, your homes. Any of these things are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger. We then wait for Allah's punishment. May Allah save us from that. So this is the love of the Messenger of Allah. Love him as a person. Love Him as a Person. As Muhammad. And hold him dear",
      "than anyone else Rasulullah said one time to Umar he will not be true believers until he that",
      "parent than his children then anybody else including his own self he was very frank he was transparent person is that the arson law you are more beloved to me than my parents your be the more beloved",
      "now you have that, now you got the Iman. Now the Imaan is complete so we all have to ask ourselves how much we love the messenger of Allah and loving the Messenger of Allah means loving him as a person and loving his Deen, loving his message take his message seriously live by his message present it to the world because he was",
      "So your duty as the one who loves Muhammad, you give this message to the world. Speak about him. Shout about him Tell him who he was and remove any mistakes, any misunderstandings from the minds of people Of course we don't force anybody to accept but at the same time we have to take it seriously Our relation with Muhammad is very important",
      "important that's part of our Eman and the stronger the relationship the better the Eman so I pray to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that to give us the EMAN of Rasulullah you as the top of Rasula law he was they devour for Sulu law and honors with the love of Allah increase this love in our heart in our behavior in our characters",
      "Rasulullah's life. The life of Rasulallah is ideal in every way, spiritually, socially, morally, individually as a person and his messenger as the teacher. Every aspect is wonderful but Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala summarized his whole life with just one sentence. One ayah",
      "is one ayah and that is actually the summary of his person as well as his mission. And we should keep that in our mind. And that is one Ayah, we all know it. And That is, وما أرسلناك إلا رحمة للعالمين And We did not send you, Allah SWT, We did Not send you except as mercy for the worlds.",
      "So Rasulullah was sent as mercy for the world. And that summarizes his whole life, that summarises his whole message. Mercy for alameen, not for muslimeen, nor mu'mineen, or one race or one tribe, one group of people. Mercy is for the worlds and the world of humans as well as the worlds of jinn and the worlds",
      "any kind of world the world of the people now and the part of the",
      "Doing good to the people. Treating them well, nicely. This is what it is. And Rasulullah used to emphasize that. Several Sahaba came and asked the Prophet ﷺ O Siniya Rasulallah! O Sniya Rasullallah! Give me some advice from Messenger of Allah. Wherever you are, fear Allah. In whatever condition, fear God. Be mindful of Allah",
      "And if you do anything bad, follow it up with something good so that you can remove the effect of the bad. And treat people in good ways. Good way. Nice way. Treat the people nicely. Your relationship with the people not with your neighbors only, not with Muslims only,",
      "وعلى سائر الصحابة والتابعين ومن تبعهم بإحسان إلى يوم الدين وعنا معهم بفضلك وكرمك يا أكرم الأكرمين ويا أرحم الراحمين اللهم عز الإسلام والمسلمين اللها هما إنا نصلك العافية والمعافاة الدائمة والفوذ بالجنة والنجاة من النار",

      "May Allah bless you, your families, keep you safe and healthy. And may Allah remove this pandemic that is affecting us and affecting people all around the world. May Allah remove it sooner insha'Allah with His blessings, mercy and kindness. So today is the 26th of Rajab",
      "and the night is the night of 27th of Rajab. Insha'Allah we will talk about Isra and Mi'raj, these two things that happen according to most reports,",
      "on the 27th night of the month of Rajab. Although there are other opinions also, so one cannot say that definitely that was the time but some people say it happened in month of Rabiul Awal Some say it was the month Ramadan, some say it",
      "the date, the month is not important. The event is important and also the Sahaba did not mention exact date and time because they were not doing anything else I mean they did not have any special prayers during this night They did not fast on the 27th day of Rajab but they remember the event",
      "unanimous that this is something happened, this great event, this miraculous event happened in the life of the Prophet. The time during which it happened, it happened when the Prophet was in Makkah. It was not in Medina. Allah SWT says",
      "Masjid al-Haram, Ilan Masjidi Al Aqsa. Glory be to him who took his servant by night from the Masjids al Haram which is the masjid of Mecca to the Masjiad al Aqsah which is a masjidd in Jerusalem so it's definitely happened when the Prophet was in Mecca and it is before the Hijrah of the Prophet from Mecca",
      "at that time, Prophet's wife Khadija and his uncle Abu Talib both of them were great supporters they passed away and for him this was the time of grief. And then he goes to Taif to invite the people of Taif",
      "they refused actually, they tortured him and threw stones upon him and the Prophet was very disheartened but as you know Allah says in the Quran with difficulty comes ease and so Isra'il Mi'raj indicates that the eases will be there Rasulullah",
      "his message will spread and many people will come into Islam and follow him. So it was like one year or one year and a half before the Hijrah, before the migration from Mecca to Medina. So Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam I mean the story is long I will just summarize it and anybody want",
      "and get more information. The basic story is this that Rasulullah was in the Masjid, in the masjid al-Haram some reports say that he was in his home during the night sleeping but both of these stories can be reconciled",
      "his home then he was brought by Jibril to the masjid so Jibrill, the great angel of Allah came to him and then from Masjid al-Haram took him on this journey there is a report also that says that he was in Hatim, Hatim is the area",
      "when the Arabs lacked funds so they made the building of Kaaba square not as it was before and so Hatim is part of the Kaaba but it is not inside the four walls of the kaaba and if you pray inside Hatim, that means you are praying in Kaaba. So Rasulullah ﷺ was there in Hatim",
      "and he had the experience of Shaqqu Sadr, that is chest was open and washed with Zamzam. And it's like a special preparation for this journey just like we make wudu Allah SWT also cleansed and purified him and he was already pure but furthermore purification in order to go on this journey",
      "journey so after that a special creature called buraq which has a very fast speed and that was presented to him and he mounted on al-burak itself the name indicates this very fast like electronic speed it mentioned that his step or his hoof",
      "or his hoof reaches where his eye reaches very fast and so he was there within moments, he was in the city of Jerusalem. And the Prophet arrived in the City of Jerusalem",
      "124,000 prophets and messengers they were gathered for him to receive him so all these prophets were there in their arwah in their reality whatever Allah knows better they were there and Rasulullah they greeted Rasulallah and he met them and then after that he led them in prayer",
      "so they were all ready to receive him and then he was their Imam, and that was a special honor of Rasulullah because all the prophets are great but Prophet Muhammad is the last prophet, the final prophet of Allah. That's why we say Sayyid ibn Adam is the leader of humanity and Imam al-anbiya wal mursaleen",
      "the Imam of the Prophets and Messengers of Allah. So Rasulullah performed the prayer at Imam, and then after that the report said that Jibril presented to him two cups one cup had milk and the other cup had wine",
      "and asked the Prophet to choose, and choose for yourself and for your Ummah. And as you may know that at that time drinking wine was not forbidden. People in Makkah they used to drink some of the Sahaba they used",
      "But then Rasulullah ﷺ chose milk and left or rejected the cup of wine. And Jibreel said, هُدِيتَ وَهُدْيَتْ أُمَّتُكُ You are guided or he said يَحُدِّيتَ لِلفِطْرَةِ You are Guided to the original natural thing. So milk is natural",
      "is natural milk is nutritious milk is good and clean and wine is fermented wine brings corruption while wine destroys the families and spoils life it is called Umm al-Khabais, the mother of all evils or mother of many evils",
      "So Rasulullah rejected that and preferred what is organic, clean, good, nutritious, natural. And that's the way of Islam and how Muslims should be. Then after that a ladder was presented to him.",
      "by which one can go up so it is a miraculous ascension that took place and Rasulullah was taken from earth to heaven and Jibril alaihissalam was with him and he goes to different all the seven heavens",
      "a prophet or each samaa. You know the word heaven is used sometimes for both sky and also for Jannah. So Jannah is not the sky, I mean samawat are not the jannah. Samawat are levels layers, saba'ah samawat intibaqaa,",
      "and then Jannah is somewhere above that, probably in the sixth and seventh heaven. So he goes to the first heaven and Gabriel seeks permission from him and he meets Adam, the first human being who greets him and says",
      "Welcome to pious son, the righteous son and welcome to the righteous Prophet. Adam is the father of all, he's the father humanity so he said Al-Ibn, Son and of course Rasulullah was the prophet of Allah so he",
      "between Adam and the Prophet we don't know only Allah knows, and the prophet knew. And then he goes to the second heaven and the same thing permission is taken for him and he enters or he goes into the second Heaven and he meets Isa and Yahya. Jesus was being born in him and Yahy was known there in English as John the Baptist",
      "and he meets both of them, they both welcome him. These are the prophets who went through a lot of difficulty, a lot persecution. Yahya was assassinated, killed, and people tried to kill Isa, Jesus. So they are in that welcoming the Prophet indicating",
      "persecution and difficulties and problems. And then he goes to the third heaven, and meets Yusuf, a most beautiful person. The Prophet said half of the beauty of the world is given to him. So Yusof met",
      "and every both Yusuf alaihissalam and before that Isha alaihi salam and Yahya alaihe salam they all of them they say marhaba bil akhis saleh wa nabiyy as-saleh righteous brother and righteous prophet Yusof is the one who went through a lot of difficulties but then his brothers came to him",
      "hidden message here that the brothers of Mecca who are persecuting you they will come to you and they will ask forgiveness as it happened when the Prophet entered Mecca at the time of the victory of Meccan so Rasulullah goes to the fourth heaven",
      "Idris is Allah says in the Quran, we gave him a high elevated place so this is Islam receives no one there is a message here that also will have a high",
      "fifth heaven and meets Harun alaihis salam, Harun he worked with Musa brother of Musa and Haroon went through difficulties and struggle so he is there and then after that on the sixth heaven",
      "went through a lot of struggle with his people and he is the one who had experience of the people in the community. And then finally, on the seventh heaven there he meets Ibrahim.",
      "Welcome to the pious righteous son and righteous prophet because Rasulullah is also a son of Ibrahim through Ismail. So he was in the family of Ibraheem and then after that Rasulallah was taken further up",
      "and then he reaches to a place called Sidrat al-Muntaha. Sidra is a tree, and this tree has the end of the created world, the order of creation. And Rasulullah described in some other hadiths that it's a beautiful tree, its leaves are very big, huge trees",
      "its roots are in the sixth heaven and then they go up all the way to the seventh heaven, and it was shining. It was brilliant illuminated. So the Noor was covering the Sidra. And then he moved on further",
      "Jibril was not with him, Rasulullah sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam went alone and he had the conversation Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala some people say that he saw Allah subhana wata'ala and some other say that no he did not see Allah subhahanawta'ala but he saw the tajalli of Allah subhaanaw",
      "is the hijab of Noor, the light. He saw that and this is the opinion of Aisha so the Prophet saw that, and Allah spoke to him just as he spoke to Musa. We don't know all the details of the conversation what did Allah say to him but one thing is mentioned",
      "very specific and great emphasis, that is Allah swt made obligatory or gave him the command that you and your ummah pray 50 prayers every day. Khamsina salawat. So 50 prayers 5-0. 50 prayers everyday. And Rasulullah",
      "the obedient servant of Allah and being His servant, Allah's servant this was the greatest honor for him. Subhanallah, the Asraa bi Abdi so whenever Allah mentioned the honor of the Prophet mentioned that the servant of allah subhana wa ta'ala so Rasulullah accepted that and then he was leaving",
      "and he came again to different heavens, on the seventh heaven he saw Ibrahim, and Ibrahim himself was a very obedient person. He did not say anything, of course he did not have large number of followers also so he had no experience of a large community but then he comes to Musa on the sixth heaven",
      "and Musa is curious. Musa asked him, what did you receive? Musa went to Mount Tur and there he had the conversation with Allah SWT then he received the commandments, he received tablets so Musa ask the Prophet, what did",
      "you were in such a wonderful place what gift you have and the Prophet said Allah told me that I and my community should pray 50 times every day Musa of course had lot of experience with people and difficulties and I had, I had my experience and I would advise that you go back and ask that prayers should be reduced",
      "and Rasulullah consulted with Jibreel and he nodded his head, and said yes go. So Rasul went and asked Allah SWT. Some say that Allah reduced five so they were 45 and some say Allah reduced 10. So we came with 45 or 40 prayers",
      "and Musa said go and ask for more reduction so Rasulullah goes again and Allah also reduced another 10 and back and forth he goes until finally it was five",
      "more reduction and the Prophet said استحييت I am embarrassed and then the call came and it said أمضيت فريدتي وخفّفت لعبادي something like that my Faridah is established but",
      "I have reduced, may give concession to my servants. So these are five but the reward is fifty. They pray five prayers but they receive the reward of 50 prayers. Rasulullah came with this gift of five prayers that he performed.",
      "and then on his return he is shown Jannah, the heaven and shown hellfire. In the heaven or hell fire he goes and sees that blessed place, the beautiful place of Jannah",
      "of hellfire. So Rasulullah was shown, given a visit, a tour of those places very quick tour of Jannah and Hellfire and he saw the people who are suffering in hellfire some of them were those who are committing adultery fornication",
      "who were involved in backbiting, some of them were those who are creating fitna's division and dissension among the people all kind of people were there in hellfire. And Rasulullah asked Jibril details and explanation and show that",
      "and again Burak was there tied to one place, he writes to Burak come back home. Come back to the Masjid al-Haram and then the Prophet himself said that you take some rest and then he told this story next day to the people of Mecca",
      "those who were Muslims, they believed in that. Although some reports say that some of them turned away from Islam but that's not very authentic. So believers believe in that especially Abu Bakr, he was not there, he did not hear from the Prophet but a non-Muslim, a kafir told him",
      "Would you believe somebody said that he was in Mecca last night and went to Jerusalem and came back? And Abu Bakr says, how can it be? I mean takes one month to go there and one month come back. They say this is your companion, your leader Muhammad. He's saying that! So Abu Bakar immediately",
      "said, if he says that then I believe it because I believe something more than that. He said that the message from heaven comes to him every now and then so this is nothing in comparison to that and that's why he was given the title as Siddiq Abu Bakr as Siddiqu, the one who confirms",
      "truth. So this is the story, as I said it's a summarized story but we can learn some lessons from that. The first lesson is the very high rank, the highest status of our Prophet Muhammad. He",
      "and he is the Imam, Imam al-Mursaleen, Imam ul Anbiya Sayyidul Bashar, Sayyidi Abu'l Adam that is the honour of Rasulullah ﷺ. And he had a leading position so his followers should also have the leading position they should give guidance they should be an example themselves role model for the humanity",
      "and guide them, lead them to the right path. That is the status of the Ummah. You are the best people. Race for mankind you command what's right forbid what is wrong. And here from this story of Israeel Mirage we see that. And we should be committed to Fitrah not to corruption",
      "option, but to fitrah the pure simple authentic nature. Fitrat Allahi allati fataran naasa alaiha la tabdeela li khalqillah Islam is deen ul-fitra, the Deen that takes people to simplicity to some goodness purity in no sense that",
      "The second thing that we learn from this is the relationship between Mecca and Jerusalem. Allah first took him from Mecca to Jerusalem, so there is Israa, Israaa is the night journey, it was at night, so Israah. So Prophet was taken from Meccan to Jerusalem. I think the wisdom in that is",
      "in that is, when Prophet was returning from Jerusalem or when he was in Jerusalem the people of Mecca asked him okay if this what happened tell us something about what is some people had visited Jerusalem so they could ask him say Chowas tell us Something. What did you see in Jerusalem? and then the Prophet described that they were amazed",
      "were amazed some of them said this is Sahara, this is magic. How come because Prophet never visited Jerusalem so how come he's describing it so accurately? He described very accurately various places in Jerusalem and he even mentioned that there are three caravans that I saw on the way back",
      "the place that he described where the caravan is, somebody said if that is true then the caravans should be here tomorrow and the caravana came on that day as he told the people so Rasulullah went from Mecca to Jerusalem",
      "between Makkah and Jerusalem. And this is a spiritual link, this is the historical link, and that is the reason that Muslims have a special feeling towards Jerusalem, our love for Jerusalem. This cannot be disconnected. Of course Jewish people have links to Jerusalem and Christians have linked to Jerusalem. All these three religions, Abrahamic",
      "their people should live in peace and harmony there. Jerusalem can play a very important role for bringing peace and Harmony in the world but unfortunately, the city of peace it is the city fight and war and violence all of these things so pray to Allah SWT that there should be peace in that city and people of that city live together caring for each other recognizing",
      "recognizing the rights of people and nobody make a claim that it is exclusively for us. And the places of worship, of all the three religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam respected and honored. That's what Muslims did when they took the city of Jerusalem in the time of Omar ibn Khattab, Jewish people were allowed to come back although the Romans have expelled them",
      "and then the Christian people various sects they were fighting each other Muslims brought peace so much so that they gave some of the Christian authorities, they gave the keys of the greatest church to Muslims. That there you are the one who holds those keys because you are one who brings peace in that area. So link between Jerusalem",
      "is very important to keep in mind. The third important lesson that we can learn from this story is the place of masjid in Islam and the place for prayers in Islam. Now Rasulullah was taken from Masjid to Masjids, he was not taken from a home or",
      "from a market, from a street to another street of Jerusalem. He was taken from masjid to masjids. Although Masjid al-Haram was not established as masjad at that time Kaaba was there of course and Masjd al-Aqsa was not in its form of masjidd later it was built as masjd but Allah SWT showed him what is going",
      "So, masjid is very important. Masjids should be honored respected and cared for. And then the highest gift that Rasulullah ﷺ received in his marriage was the gift of Salat. In all the other obligations of Islam that we have Siyam and Zakat and Hajj and",
      "by angel coming from above to the earth and giving him the order for Salat he's called up come in the presence of Allah SWT and receive this order so Rasulullah loved Salah, Qurratu Aini Fis-Salat my happiness the happiness of my eyes is in Salat although Allah SWt reduced",
      "the 50 prayers to 5 prayers but Rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam throughout his life from that moment on until then he observed 50 rakah every day so 4 prayers, 5 prayers 17 Rakah Sunnah 12 Rakah and then the Prophet used to pray Tahajjud prayer",
      "eight rakah and then three vitra, and also he used to pray two rakah before that. So 13. And then after Fajr until the noon time in between calls Ad-Doha, he used",
      "50 rak'ah. And prayer is the purpose of creation. وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونَ The Quran from the very beginning says that, الَّذِينَ يُقِيمُون الصَّلَاةِ Very first page of the Quran. الَّزِينُ يُقيْمُون صَّلَّاةٍ And all the prophets used to tell their people to pray.",
      "and Rasulullah ﷺ when he was on his deathbed, he said as-salat, as-salaat, al-sulaat, observe the salaah, don't miss the salaat. So prayer has a very important place in Islam. Of course the prayer should be done with consciousness, with awareness. Prayer if it is done in the right way",
      "way, it protects people prevents people from sin and corruption. Unfortunately there are people who pray and they do all kind of bad things that means their prayer is not the right prayer or their prayer in not the prayer of sincerity, the prayer devotion because the prayer and devotion and sincerity changes the personality, changes the behavior. The fourth important lesson",
      "reality of heaven and hell. Jannah is real, and Jahannam is real. So this is not imagination. This is not just a story. This the reality. Rasulullah was shown those places that they do exist and they will exist and there will be some people who go to Jannah and there'll be some",
      "May Allah protect us from that. A little trouble, a little fear makes us so worried. This coronavirus is making people so worried! But what about the hellfire? What about Jahannam? What will be the Day of Judgement? We all have to learn that we have to take lessons on that because the problem is that we think Jahannum is story",
      "or some people say yes but it is not for us somebody else oh we all have to be conscious of that yes coronavirus is not going to affect everybody but people are concerned everybody is concerned about it so it is very very important to take this seriously and have your desire for jannah",
      "eternal place of goodness and it is the place where you are going to see Allah SWT. And the fifth point that we learn from this story of Isra and Miraj is, that values, virtues and vices are there. The virtues are important. Muslims should be committed to morality.",
      "must be committed to good deeds, good actions, justice, kindness, charity, good relations, good families, good communities, good neighborhood. Care of each other, care for other people, peaceful life. That is what it's all about and Jannah is all about that. And so Rasulullah saw the people of Jannah, the people who will go to Jannah",
      "and Rasulullah saw what happens when people behave in the wrong way, they do corruption and injustice. May Allah make us from among the people of Jannah and save us protect us from becoming the people",
      "We pray to Allah SWT to guide us and keep us on the right path. So this is a great event, it is absolutely truth that happened. The story is not something you can say we don't know what has happened or not happened. It's unanimously mentioned. Many many reports of that.",
      "that from the Sahabah of Allah, reporting that Rasulullah mentioned that and it came from the mouth of Rasulallah himself. He is the one who described what happened so there is no question about the truth of Isra'il Mi'raj dates and details of which day and what month and all of these things yes those things are some people remember some people do not remember so if this is the night of Isri'il mi'raj may ALLAH SWT",
      "Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala bless us and we are gathered together to remember that event but the most important thing is to learn the lessons, the lessons of Israeel Mi'raj. And pay attention to the lessons Of Israelei Mi'raji. May Allah bless you.",
      "by Ijmaeen. Now you might say that what about this masjid is being closed and we are not praying in the Masjid, Jama'at prayer? Well that is a special reason. This is because of the virus and we don't want to see people be affected. We don't",
      "experts, the reliable authorities they're telling us that we should avoid that and it happened in Islamic history before that. In the 11th century there was a plague in the city of Cordoba and it is reported the massages were locked in the City of Cordobas",
      "in the city of Ta'az, Yemen, in the 14th century. There was a plague and it is mentioned that",
      "from spreading the infection and same thing happened also in mecca in the year in the 18th century or 19 early 19th century in mexico in baghdad",
      "So it is mentioned that people were died in",
      "People died in their homes and they were not able to bury them. There was nobody to claim their money, there was a bad smell by the dead bodies and animals died. Most of the animals died at that time. This is mentioned in the year 1247 A.D.,",
      "after Hijrah that is around 1831 in that time so may Allah protect us from that horrible thing and in the situation like that yes it is very important that you protect the human beings and and the masajid close but that doesn't mean that you don't pray, you can make Jama'a your home",
      "And may Allah SWT have this pandemic go away very soon. We have some questions, inshaAllah if you want to ask questions, yes please write your question.",
      "You can submit your questions over the chat window that you have. 15 minutes, inshallah. So, Brother Omar, let me see the questions of the people. Yeah, no questions so far but if anybody has any questions, if you go to your screen at the very bottom there's a chat button. If you click chat, you can go ahead and submit a question and then we'll read it to Dr. Siddiqui over.",
      "feel free to type them in. Okay, there's a question that's come in. Do you suggest any specific duas for tonight? No, there is no specific dua. You just make the general dua or dua especially for this coronavirus.",
      "virus. Yesterday at the message of Jumu'ah, I read a dua and that dua you can get it on the Islamic Society website with the translation or simply say",
      "taqfar and tawbah, and dua that we should do very often so that Allah SWT removes this problem from us insha'Allah. And also at the same time observe the rules because in our religion it is very important that people pay attention to dua and to asbab. Asbab you say",
      "Allah provides for us, but then you also have to cook the food and you have to go and do the job and have money and bring things and cook. And then you eat and then you will have nutrition. So these are aswabs. Similarly if you want to protect yourself, make dua and at the same time take dawa and precautions. Both of these things are important.",
      "to pray to Allah SWT as well as take all the precautions that are necessary and inshallah, the ultimate giver of shifa is Allah. Dawa becomes only a sabbath but the reality is that it only comes from Allah.",
      "it did not help them and there are a lot of people who do not use the one they have but at the same time rule is that you should use the law because the cool leader in the law said to the people take the law liquid for every melody for every disease there is a medicine people know it some people don't know it so may allah",
      "Shifa comes from Allah. He is the one who gives us shifa. BarakAllahu feekum There's a follow-up question someone is asking Is there any benefit to praying all night on this specific night? Or doing any special prayers throughout the night tonight As I said, if you are talking about",
      "the night of 27th Rajab, special prayers for this night. So there are no special prayers on this night not according to Quran and Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad. There is nothing authentic in the Quran or Hadith that says that on the night you should have this or that prayer or keep awake the whole night",
      "or you should fast the following day. There is no such thing. So don't do it thinking that I'm doing it because this is the sunnah of rajab but do it if you want to, you can do it as to pray to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala anytime you pray to allah inshaAllah you receive the blessings of Allah. Okay there's a few other questions i think for the folks",
      "Dr. Siddiqui has covered these points through this lecture, this lecture is going to be the recording of the video will be posted on Facebook and on YouTube so you can probably go through and listen to these points as some people are asking for a summaries of the conversation between Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and Prophet Muhammad. So yeah I would encourage you all to listen to the video again, the recording. Any other questions? Does anybody else have please post",
      "Okay, I think I don't see any new questions coming in there a lot of people thanking you dr. Siddiqui for this enlightening talk May Allah bless you may Allah bless and protect you BarakAllahu feekum Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh Waalaikumsalam thank you everyone"

So there are some certain changes in the rules and regulations but the core ethics of the deen is the",

I was helpless and they did so much for me. And especially if the mother, the right of the mother is emphasized much more. وَبِالْبَالِذِين يَحْسَىٰتُ And then Allah SWT said, وَلَا تَقْطُرُوا وَلادُكُمْ مِنْ إِمْلَاءٍ After the parents,",

All of these things people hide inside and they come out very nice in front of the people and look very good. But actually they're hiding a lot of sin inside. These are called amrād al-qulūb.

      "السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته",
      "أعطيك الله من شرور أنفسنا ومن سيئات عمالنا",
      "All praise be to Allah the Lord of the worlds and peace and blessings upon His Prophets and Messengers.",
      "on the problem with I'm a lot of money one-time people all over the world and it was not that long while and everything home what's up I thought I'd fun or that a lot more about my own yeah you know a lot about what he well I don't know who knew him",
      "and do not let the death come to you unless you are submitting to Allah. May Allah make us among those who submit to Allah all the time. Rasulullah when he came from the cave of Hira, and he received the message of Iqra after that, the first message that came to him was",
      "of a captain oh the one who is wrapped up stand up and warn and your lord magnify and your Lord proclaim his greatness so first message of Islam is to claim the greatness of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala",
      "Allah is the statement of faith. Allah is a statement of truth. Allah Is the statement reality. There is no one who is greater than Allah. There's no one more powerful than Allah, there's noone more mighty than Allah",
      "There is one who can answer the prayers better than Allah, and there is no one who is more loving than Allah. And there is not one who's more just than Allah. Allahu Akbar is a very short statement only two words but it contains everything. It summarizes the whole message of Islam.",
      "every Adhan six times. In Iqamah four times or six times according to the various schools some say Allah Hu Akbar, Allah Hu bar four times and some say Allahu Akbar two times so four times all six time when you start your prayer you start to pray with Allahu Akbar and then in every Raka'a five times",
      "Forkut, if you pray 90 times you say Allahu Akbar. And then you say your sunnah and your nabafat at least 100 times. And after every prayer you say tasbihat, subhanallah, allhamdulillah, Allahu akbar again you say 33 to 34 times.",
      "At least, at least any observant Muslim saying this Allahu Akbar 400 times, 405 times every day. Every day 400 times and this is only in the prayer. It is a statement of Ibadah. It's a statement",
      "I am repeating this to emphasize that there is only one who is great, who is the greatest one. This is to recognize the greatness of Allah because Takbir, Allah says in the Quran",
      "Say Alhamdulillah, thank you to Allah the one who has no son, no offspring. He has no partner in his kingdom. He does not need any protector from any weakness and make him proclaim His greatness.",
      "literally it means making big and allah will pick up what you don't make a lot of big so that means recognize his bigness recognizes greatness recognizes glory in majesty and you mentioned that you proclaim that when you make something very common this microphone is making my voice big so you can all hear that",
      "bring allah subhanahu wa ta'ala in your mind and heart pay attention to allah they will ignore him there are people who make other things big they make people make their desires bigger very big my desire whatever is my desire some people make money very big",
      "Everybody has something that they think is big for them. And they focus on that, they pay attention. But where is Allah in your life? We have to ask ourselves this question. Where is Allah In my life? Is Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala the focus of my life, his centre of my Life or have I put him somewhere in the corner? Make Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la the last and least.",
      "But what is the priority? What is most important? What's my ultimate concern? Something else. This is a question that we have to ask ourselves because we are saying again and again Allah-u Akbar! Why are you saying that? What do we mean by it? Where is my attention to Allah? And my attention of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala means my faith, my iman,",
      "All of these things you have to ask this question. And the other thing is that there are many people, you know Allah is not a war cry. Some people think it's just on the battlefield to say Allahu Akbar. It's not a bad cry. It is a statement of faith.",
      "The action that is wrong. I cannot say that. Allah Almighty always, the meaning is that I am doing good, I'm doing my best and praise be to Allah. Because there are people who make themselves big and the Quran calls them mustaqbirin, mutakabirin. They consider themselves big. So Muslims are not mutaqbireen, mustaqubireeen. Muslims are mukabbiren",
      "And then the difference between Takbir and Istiqbar or Takabr. Takbir is calling Allah great, IstiQbar is also calling someone else great. So real greatness belongs to Allah. وَلَهُ الْكِبْرِيَّةَ الْقِبِرِیَّةُ رِدَائِي The Hadith of Qudsi says that the greatness of Takbriya is my clock",
      "Don't snatch this micro from me and give it to somebody else or take it yourself. Recognize the greatness of Allah. That means make Allah your focus, your center, your attention to Allah. Not only in masjid, but also in your business, in your home, in relations, everything! Make Allah great. Consider Allah great",
      "لديهم شعور أن الله يقول لا تنسيه. قال الله سبحانه وتعالى نَصُلَّاها فَأَنْسَاهُمْ أَنفُسَهُم أُولَئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ فَإِذْ كُنُوا وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ أَصِلَّاهُ فَأنْساهُ مَنَفُوسَهِمْ وَلا تكونوا كالَّدِّينَ اصُّلَّاحَ فِأَرْضَاهِم مَا انْسـاهُوا أَلْفُثَهَمْ",
      "themselves will I go home first upon they are the rebellious people there that is to be in peace they are all yours so believers keep Allah subhanAllah always in their mind loving kind merciful compassionate but at the same time offer them probably told shall even a heart told la la la his most forgiving except the Toba",
      "When we make mistakes, we can come to Him and ask for forgiveness but at the same time, shadidu liyaqaam. Severe in punishment, very mighty, very powerful. There is no one who is more powerful than Allah. The other thing that we have to keep in mind when we say Allahu Akbar,",
      "the people of allah who is saying that muslim as people who say what are we doing are we bringing greatness to allah by our words by our deeds by our behavior or making allah low or putting down the name of allahu in the mind of other people so our behavior should not show our behavior",
      "Don't let down Allah. Don't make Allah low and small in the minds of others because of your behavior. So Muslims should be those by their action, Allah will glorify them. Allah will recognize them as great because they do great things. They do great deeds.",
      "ونحن نعيش حج والسكر في مكان ما يتحدث عنه الله أكبر الله أمباراة",
      "Allah, repeating them. Ibrahim was the man who put Allah in the center of his life. He was willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of Allah. He sacrificed his town, city, family, father and possessions. And even finally when Allah understood that this is the will of Allah, he gave him a son.",
      "اس نے کہا کہ ابراہیم اپریلین تھا۔ وہ اپنے نام سے ایک عمت تھا ، اپنا ہر مجال کے لئے اپراہم ایک حدود تھا اور انسان کی طرف میں وہ ایک ہے جو یہ عمہ کر رہا تھا، وہ امام تھا وہ بڑھ گیا تھا جو بہت ساروں لوگوں کو تصور کر رکھی تھا شاکر علی و عمری",
      "they've given him. Allah swt has chosen him.",
      "somebody something in his mind that these are my idols, these are My ultimate. The only Allah. Hanifa. So Allahu Akbar, my brothers and sisters is a statement that should make you do the right things because when we commit sin that means",
      "we are not recognizing Allah's greatness by our own behavior, in our own mind. So we have to avoid that. Allahu Akbar means that we should be put in the forefront of doing good things, charitable acts so that we recognize Allah's greatness, Allah's graciousness, mercy and kindness. And we are merciful and kind to His creation.",
      "and Allah the Greatest means that Muslims should be excelling in everything. Muslims should excel in education, invention, business, doing things that will bring benefit to humanity so people say this is the community of Allah.",
      "by the greatness of the people. And also at the same time, Allah Akbar means that we should not be intimidated. We should not consider ourselves in any kind of low. Whatever difficulty may be, Allah is great.",
      "against all those who threaten, against all of those who speak against Allah. Against those who oppress, those who do dhulm. Allahu Akbar ala quwwal aqwiya wa'ala dhullim zhalimeen. Allah is greater than the most powerful power and Allah is",
      "So Muslims, when we have this faith in Allah and we say Allahu Akbar, it's very strong. Very strong. Strong to do good, not strong to do bad things, strong to doing good things. That is what the Prophet was told first thing,",
      "Alhamdulillah. The greatness of Allah and the love of Allah. These are two most important things. Recognize the greatness, and have this love in your heart.",
      "Those who believe, they love Allah most. There are people who say that they love allah but they put somebody else in between. There're people who put their own self, their own desires, but the believers, their iman,their faith, their love of Allah swt is hardened deep to love all Allah more than anything else",
      "ونحن جزء من أعوام الله ، أعطاء الله",
      "your homes that you like all of these things if they are more important to you than allah and his messenger then watch what will happen so let us have our priority correct let us keep our faith strong and inshallah that will be that will guide us that will help us",
      "وعلى سائر الصحابة والتابعين ومن تبعهم بإحسان إلى يوم الدين اللهم عز وجل",
      "اللهم تل الحياة زيادة لنا من كل خير والموت راحة لن من كل شر إبا تضع رحمتك الله إن صلاة النهارين فحشية ومنكر ولذكر الله أكبر"

      "This movement looks to me as one of the most modern and largest Islamic movements. It is doing wonderful work in education, in social work, providing relief and other services that are doing that.",
      "By God he is not a believer, by God he's not a...",
      "My name is Muzammil Siddiqui and I am director of the Islamic Society of Orange County in Garden Grove, California. I also teach at Chapman University in City of Orange in California",
      "Council of North America, chairman of the Shura council that is a council of all Islamic centers in Southern California. So I am working in different organizations for the last 40 years here in America. We have here in Orange County, California number of representatives from the movement,",
      "and recently I met a number of good brothers like Abdulrahim Ozcan, Khalil and others. And so very impressed with the kindness and humbleness and their dedication. Hizmet Movement I only knew briefly from my reading as well as my recent visit to Turkey.",
      "I am very impressed. This movement looks to me as one of the most modern and largest Islamic movements. It is doing wonderful work in education, social work, providing relief and other services that it's doing that. In my visit I met many people",
      "ordinary people as well as scholars and leaders of the movement at various universities and colleges, as well met people in their homes. So through these visits I found that may Allah bless them it looked like people are very dedicated sincere and also devoted to the work that they're doing",
      "What is the biggest problem in the Muslim world today?",
      "And we must all be together It is very much mentioned in the Quran that is Hold to the rope of Allah together and be not divided Do not fight each other because then do not quarrel with each other Then that will lead to failures and defeat So this is a very important issue that bring the people together second thing is",
      "Second thing is education. We are lacking in education, although we are not lacking in resources. Last month I had given a lot of resources to the people, oil resources and many other natural sources that were there but still we have not established educational institutions, good schools, universities, colleges. We're also suffering a lot from poverty",
      "There are so many people who do not find even to eat food. So, the people are living in abject poverty. It is important that people should help and provide for people, not just by hand out but ways to be employed. Work possibilities for the people different way so that people can work and earn and live a dignified life. Also we have diseases.",
      "lot of people suffering and all that today there is no excuse for people to die with small cholera and all of these things. These things can be treated very well, and their resources available so we should have a lot of hospitals, lot of clinics and Muslims do not lack doctors they are many doctors the doctor",
      "the people. All of these things, on one hand you invite and unite the people, on the other hand you have to take care of their education, poverty, diseases. This is what is needed today. The many movements are becoming too much focused on politics. And then fights started between government and movement. That's not right. What is important is that focus on social work.",
      "What is the movement of the Prophet?",
      "So whatever we do, we make an effort. And I see that there's good efforts going on. I don't know all the details but whatever I learn it looks to me as a good movement. It is authentically Islamic because it recognizes the basic principles of Islam, Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet. And its Aqeedah is sound Aqeadah Alhamdulillah.",
      "I see that it is Islamic movement. It has its roots in Islam, its principles are Islamic and on this basis but at the same time this is a movement in modern times so you have to understand your relevance to the time in which you are. Everything we do as human beings are not universal human beings. We human beings",
      "the situation, the conditions around us. So if you look from that perspective yes it is addressing the issues and challenges and problems that Muslims are facing today. The significant difference I saw and understand is emphasis on education which is very important",
      "It has established hundreds of schools, actually thousands of schools not only in Turkey but also around the world. So it's paying a lot of attention to education of young people as well as adults those who go to universities and colleges so I saw some of the universities and college and also it is heavily involved in social work now there are other movements also involved",
      "which is very much needed in the Muslim world. But this I found that they are very professional, went to their relief organization, its headquarter was very impressed with the kind of expertise and paying attention to the details how to provide services to the people especially if there's a natural disaster",
      "disaster, earthquake someplace. How to go and immediately help the people first of all to save the people who are trapped under the heavy stones or some other structures? How to take them out? So I saw the whole machinery and trucks ready there to help that tents to be provided and food to be provide many other things so these kind of thing knowing the details",
      "with the details. This is very good to have that, so it's not just volunteers are there and with good will they're going to help people but you have to know how to do that. So know-how and professionalism this is very important and I was very impressed with that.",
      "of visitors is an excellent program. Taking Muslims and non-Muslim people, especially those who are in the leadership position it is important that they should go on. It's very educational and very inspirational and also it brings better understanding of cultures",
      "in a very professional way. So I must praise the movement for that, that the people who are there and they're scores of people that take good care of them and show them different places and do not impose anything on the people, don't say keep on brainwashing them, no that's not the way, they don't do that, they simply this is what we have to show them so",
      "So this is very good and will help in bringing cultures closer to each other. I wish there were other Muslim countries doing that because we have so much that people can see in the Muslim world but I'm glad Turkey has taken initiative on that and Hizmet Movement people are doing that, this is really important",
      "This program should continue. Turkish people, they need this movement and this movement of course needs the help of the government although the movement is not a political movement it does not involve in politics but at the same time there are many areas where the government should not hinder",
      "of the movement and should be supportive if not collaborating with at least support. And at least does not hinder, does not create a problem. So there should be...the movement is peaceful movement it's not involved in any violence or anything like that so this is good. That's what we have to do. We have to support and encourage peaceful movements in the Muslim world.",
      "and the philosophy that Mr. Ghulam espouses provides for all people, not only Christians or Muslims but for all to share their ideas and have a greater understanding of Islam and that it is a religion of peace and unity.",
      "All of these things are great emphasis in Islam. So I'm glad that Hizmet Movement has taken one of its top priorities to pay attention to education."

This is your brother Dr. Muzamil Siddiqui speaking to you on behalf of North American Islamic Trust. As we enter the last 10 nights of this blessed month of Ramadan, I ask what would you do",
      "If your neighborhood masjid had to close its doors or cut its programs because of the lack of funds, where will you go for your daily prayers? For your taraweeh prayers? Or the funerals? Or to send your children to learn their deen, the Quran. There are some masajids in America, in the poorest neighborhoods they're going through this difficulty. Died situations",
      "that are struggling to keep their doors open and to keep the programs. And it is the responsibility of the larger community to help them. Alhamdulillah, in the last five years when the NET started this program providing them some financial help and masajid were able to maintain themselves I appeal to you again to be generous in this blessed bandha of Ramadan",
      "of Ramadan and help us to help the masajid in the poor neighborhood. Why NED has to do that? Because the masjids themselves do not have the expertise, and they do not the community in their neighborhood that can help them. NED had access to many masajids in America, and we know their situation. Any good deed done in the month of Ramadan, there is reward many times,",
      "many fault times. Allah multiplies for whomsoever He wills. Please be generous. This is a month of kindness and consideration, so I appeal to you to help the masajid as you do other programs to continue serving their communities. May Allah bless you.

I'll ask you to cotton Naveen That means if the general is not there, then how can it be specific there? Because this person has to be a nabee before he become your soul",
      "every rasool is nabi not every nabee is rasul so allah says the last of the prophets of allah that means he's the last prophet and his last messenger and the last messenger last rasool at the same time there is no rasool after him and there is",

Anything else but not Islam so Mormons say Joseph Smith was a prophet, Sikhs say Guru Nanak was a Prophet, Baha'is say Bahá'u'llah was a Prophets, Ahmadiyya say Ahmadi was a profit. These are all different religions without Islam",

      "So there are a cam and I come say that you fast during the month of Ramadan Fasting is obligated in the month for those who are healthy and those were not traveling And You have to get up early in the morning, and you stop eating at particular time And then you have eating you have your start at a particular time",
      "and what is Sunnah in the fast, and what nafl about fasts. And also it tells you what makes your fast valid or what makes you fast invalid. So all these ahkam details that are mentioned in the Quran, in the sunnah of the Prophet, elaborated by our fuqaha. And anybody who wants to fast he should learn those. He should know them. Some people may know more details but everybody has to have some basic knowledge of this thing.",
      "But at the same time, you have to know what is the spirit of fasting? What is the maqsad of fasting. So first of all, fasting has to be done the way Rasulullah did that. You know our Ahkam when we make our Salat, the Prophet says, Pray as you have seen me praying. So we follow try to as much follow as much the way of Rasulallah as possible",
      "The Prophet and he took the people for Hajj. He said, Take from me your Manasik, your rituals of Hajj, your rites of Haj, you take from me follow that So it is very important that one should follow But following also requires intention So Maqsad means they have to have intention Niyah",
      "Intention is very important. What is the intention? Why I'm doing it for whom I am doing it what is the purpose all that so that is one has to remind oneself and wants to keep aware of that And you start your fast, and you have the intention when you break your fast You have the intension and you say that I'm fasting for the sake of Allah whether you say it or not Say it is just that not they show the issue is it must be there in your heart It must be in your",
      "It must be in your heart. The heart is the place of intention, the mind is the Place of Intention. So intention must be there and there must be Ikhlas, sincerity That is fasting is only for the sake of Allah. Of course you cannot show your fast to anybody else This is very important thing I mean Salat You can show, Zakat you can show Hajj you show of course because when you go people see you but who knows your fast?",
      "Nobody knows your fast except you and Allah. It is between you and Allaah. So fasting inculcates ikhlas, it gives you the training of ikhlaas, sincerity for the sake of Allah. And it should be done with iman and ihtisab. That's why you find in the hadith of the Prophet,",
      "All his sins are forgiven. So ihtisab is that I am seeking the ajr from Allah, not for anybody else. My objective is nothing except the rida of Allah SWT, except the approval of Allah swt. Seeking the face of Allah, seeking the acceptance of Allah and approval of allah SWT.",
      "If the staff is also that one is seeking the reward in the hereafter That in the ultimate life you shall receive the reward for that so man come around on a man and what he said Who say what it stands up during the moment of Ramadan in prayer in prayers? That will insulate allah with a to serve with Eman Man, come on. I'll tell you my name is seven. Oh fair. Hello matter. God doesn't mean that we emphasize very much in the hadith of the Prophet",
      "That is between me and between Allah SWT and a human being. And I will give a special reward for it. يَدْعُوا طَعَامَهُ وَشَرَابَهِ وَسَحْوَتَهَ لِأَجْلِ He leaves his food, his drink and his desires for my sake. For the sake of Allah SWt. So this is a special link with Allah SWт. That's why you read in Surah Al-Baqarah ayat that speak about fasting.",
      "When my servant asks you about me I am near So qurb of Allah is achieved through fasting and you know in the Quran there are 15 places where the question is they ask you And then Allah says say to them O Prophet but here Allah did not even say to the prophet",
      "Prophet say Allah simply says Allah answered himself even if not said that oh Muhammad you say that but Allah said Himself I am near so nearness of Allah is something we have to realize and one of the great scholars said very nicely he said",
      "Allah is close without distance",
      "Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala may be very close to one person and the person sitting next to him is not close to him So every person has to realize that and Taqarruf ila Allah is the great Ibadah Seeking the closeness to Allah SWT in the Quran there is ayat, Ayatu Sajdah Which I am NOT going to recite but you know that it's Suratul Alaq Allah SWt said that last ayah says that make sajdah come close",
      "Say that bring you closer to Allah a person is closest to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala when he or she is in said that So say that brings us close To Allah subhana wata'ala and this closeness of Allah swt. Is very important is the greatest beauty It is the greater joy of a believer to be in the presence of Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la And we should always strive for that",
      "And then the Qalubu l'Allah SWT also comes with Tawbah. Tawba, turning to Allah is not just repentance from sin but tawbah is turning to allah SWT That's why Rasulullah SAW said in one of the hadiths O believers make tawba I do that 70 times So naudhu billahi the meaning is not that I commit sin and that's why I make tawa 70 times",
      "Tawbah 70 times. No, it is coming with humbleness. It makes you humble. It make you realize your relation with Allah SWT. So turn to Allah. Turn to Allah all the time. And then also you do istighfar. Ask Allah's maghfira. Forgiveness. We need for maghfirah. We want to know what I did in the past.",
      "فقط ما قمت به في الماضي وما قمته بعده، ماذا قمتي بذلك بشكل عبارة عنه وما كانت أفعلها خصوصاً من ذكرى وما كنت تعرفه أكثر مني حول نفسي لا نعلم حولنا نحن لا ندرك ذلك. هذا هو السطح والسطح يجب أن يتم إلقاءه. الأمر الآخر بالصلاة هي أن الصلاة تخلق على الشخص معروفة ومعتقدات معروضة",
      "An awareness of doing justice to others. Do good things to others So you discipline yourself and you go through hunger And to go through inconvenience, and then you know how much people are going through suffering in pain and difficulty so you try to serve others and Be generous and be good to others",
      "It is the month of patience and it is a month of Generosity and kindness and caring for the others. So we have to care for all We have to do good things towards other people And that's why a lot of people give their zakat during the month Ramadan and People become very generous during the months of Ramadan, the doors of generosity open during the Month of Ramadan These are some of the very important values of this month",
      "of this month that we have to learn and of course discipline is required. Ramadan teaches us how to control ourselves, we have control ourselves from our passions and our desire especially in a society in which you're living people think that whatever you desire should do it",
      "But a Muslim is the Prophet said You will not be believer unless your desire become true under to my control and the thing that I brought under the message that I bought So all kind of passions or kind of desires people may have but they have to be regulated. They have to regulate it Yes, people are other faiths. They had their own way of life",
      "of life, but as Muslims we have to know what is our way. Without any discrimination without any violence without any aggression to anyone but at the same time people have to live by their principles. Unfortunately things that happened last Sunday in Orlando we condemn that behavior. We have spoken strong against it. This is not Islamic. You don't",
      "But it is totally against the teachings of Islam to go and kill anybody. Doesn't mean that we approve the action. Doesn' t mean that you approve lifestyle. People have different lifestyles, people have different ways but what is Muslims way? Muslims have to live by their own way, by their standard without violating other peoples rights, without discriminating against others, without becoming aggressive",
      "Aggression is wrong. I do not understand that when Muslim condemn the killing that doesn't mean that Muslim approve Lifestyles life orientation Orientation people have their own orientation, but as far as Muslims our way is certain rules that are given to us we follow and certain things are forbidden for us Our Hava our desire",
      "Our desires have to be regulated that way so that's what we do and We stand for that as a witness to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala the witness to mankind but without acts of violence without aggression So no compromise on from the values. No compromise on ethical principles and the moral principles of Islam But at the same time one has to understand What is the right way if you are living in a society with of different people of different faiths or different cultures?",
      "different cultures, different lifestyles. One has to understand one has to and what is the right way of doing things? The right way for doing thing is to understand have the Hikmah and have the vision and understanding and give the message and be a good example but don't condemn anybody don't speak this way or that way all of course there should be no violence",
      "The violence they condemned the killing But Muslims of course stand with their own standard We follow what is a loss one that I had allowed and if we say and what what is right? We say it is right. What he was not is right to say is not right So we pray to Allah swt that we stay on the right path And we stand as a witness to the right thing inshallah, and you follow the way of the Quran the way for us Allah Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and may Allah keep us on that part may Allah accept our past",
      "fast and give us the spirit of fasting, the spirit discipline, the Spirit of self-control, the spirt of kindness and compassion and charity towards others.",
      "So there's a very nice Expression that used by some scholars they say don't be Ramadhanis, but be Rabbani",
      "Be Rabbani, that means we follow the way of the Lord. As the Quran says that. So be Rabbani. That means this spirit should remain after Ramadan as well. It's not just in Ramadan but should remain continue after Ramadan and so Ahkam and Maqasid if they are followed in the right way then InshaAllah the real purpose is achieved. The real purpose",
      "One who does not leave the bad words and the bad deed, Allah does not care if that person leaves his food and drink. The whole thing is not just to leave food and ring and any on some other physical activities But what is there is that leave the wrong things? Why the wrong thing in words and actions that is objective fast so",
      "اللہ ایک سالح کا مقابلت نہیں ہے اس کی طرحیت کو یقین کرنے کے لئے اور جو بھی صرفی ہے تو نبی پاکﷺ کے طور پر یہ طریقہ ہے کہ ہماری دنیا میں",
      "میں آپ کو اپنے دلوں سے بھی مطابق چیزیں کرنا چاہتا ہوں کہ کچھ بھائیوں ہیں جو اس کا رسالہ پر آخر سکھ رہے ہیں یہ مسلمان کی تصور اور قبول کے بارے میں ہے یہ ایک نظام نے 1991 سے عمل ہوئی ہے",
      "After death my body be prepared for burial according to the Islamic law.",
      "ہے جو اپنے خاندار کے لئے محضور کر سکتا ہے آپ کو اس کی طرف سے بھی پیش کرسکتے ہیں اور وہ کچھ تصمیرات ہیں جو اس کا قسم میں ہوجائیں گے۔ یہ ان شاء اللہ ہمیں صحبت کرنا چاہئے کہ ہم جانے والے ہوگئے ، اللہ تعالیٰ ہمارے زندگیوں کو دل و حفاظت اور عزت کرے اور ہم نے ایمان اور تقوی�ah رکھا ہے لیکن اسی وقت ہم ہم نامی",
      "اور ربما یہ اجازتوں کو کچھ مصالحہ کرنا چاہئے۔ اس کے لیے ہر جنگ میں آپ اس کی ضرورت نہیں ہے۔ وہ ہیں، وہ پہلے ہیں ، تو اندھیار کریں۔",

      "Mr. Siddiqui said that this MMCC is very important, they have a very good plan. Please if you can buy the grave at least pick up the card and keep it in your wallet. As you know that last year we had couple of incidents in hospital quarters there was some unknown people passed away, they did not have identity but by their name they think he was a Muslim",

      "or email office at isocmuscat.org and don't forget to please donate generously at give.isosmoscats.org today what is the",
      "السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام على سيد المرسلين",
      "May Allah bless all of you and keep you safe and healthy. Inshallah, you and your families and those our brothers and sisters who are not well we pray to Allah to give them shifa. We have a request especially from sister Ghada",
      "May Allah bless her and give her the shifa. Our dear brother Manzoor Shaykh, also in the hospital, please make dua for him. May Allah give him shifa and all the other people those who passed away may Allah give them maghfirah and give patience to their families. So today inshaAllah we'll be studying section number 16 of Surat al-Baqarah starting with the ayah",
      "Ayah 130 until the ayat number 141. In the previous section we ended with the Dua of Ibrahim and Ismail when they were building the Ka'bah, at that time the city was established, they established",
      "was as you know believers whatever concern they have they express it in their dua asking Allah to help them I mean we make our effort but at the same time we turn to Allah to",
      "and then and so these are the concerns. The first is the safety of the city, safety is very important, safety security people not have any turmoil inside and outside",
      "Islamic center, a masjid. We have to make sure that our place is safe and we try to help in the safety of the place. The second thing is waqf warduk ahlahu minas sam'aad economic well-being of the people. That is also essential that people have food shelter basic needs of their life they should",
      "the masajid have to help that, that the people who are coming to pray and people who were being served by the masjids their needs are taken care of as well. And we have to work for that. Then of course he built a Kaaba and asked Allah to accept that He said رَبَّنَا تَقُبلْ مِنَّهِ He and Ismail both of them said Oh Allah accept from us so that means the building is for the sake of Allah",
      "Allah not for anything else sincere work and the purpose is to do it for the sake of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala. Number four he and his children remain Muslims and do their duties of worship in the right way.",
      "that means before you pray for your children, that they be Muslims and they pray. You should also make sure that you pray and you are the one who will be the role model for them so that's what Ibrahim alaihi salam and Ismail were saying that make us Muslims help us to remain Muslims and then also make our children our progeny Muslims",
      "Muslima Tallaq. And remember the word Islam we use that and will be using it also in the coming ayat, Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la mentioned that Islam means submission to Allah so this is not a religion that started with Prophet Muhammad SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam This is the religion of all the Prophets of Allah and it is Allah who established",
      "So it is not Muhammadanism, it is the name of anybody or anybody's name but it is a message of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala that he gave to humanity and all the prophets of Allah. They asked their people to submit to Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la, obey Allah Subhaanahu wa Ta-a'la and that is what Islam is so that's why they say make our children Muslims. Muslims not in the sense of",
      "belonging to this community in particular but it is rather in general the universal Islam that was given to all humanity through the prophets of Allah and also worship Allah in the right way. Worship must be done in the Right Way as given to us by the prophet of Allah. And then finally he made a prayer",
      "a prophet among them, رَبَّنَا وَبَسْوِيهِمْ رَسُولًا مِّنْهُ So he prayed that Allah sent a Prophet who will continue teaching them and guiding them and make them grow. You know they mentioned the three things يُعْلِمُهُمُ الْكِتَابُ يَطْوَ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ آيَاتِكَ Recite your ayat to them وَيُعَلِّمُهمُ الٱكِـٰبَ وَالْحِقْمَةَ And teach them the Book and Wisdom",
      "grow in purity so the job of the leader is to give them the message of Allah explain the message and then also help the people grow in goodness and that is both of them are important and so Ibrahim prayed for a prophet when you are building a masjid when you're building an Islamic center",
      "Prophethood has come to an end with the coming of the last prophet Muhammad. There is no other prophet that we can pray for. But, we are praying for good teachers, for good leaders. So it is like praying for the city, praying for",
      "and the families that will be associated with the masjid as well as the masjed should have good leaders, good imams so that they will continue teaching them and make people grow. So these should be our concerns as well it's not just Ibrahim's concern but this is a concern that must be for all people. So then we come to",
      "the ayat that we are going to have today and so Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says",
      "In the name of Allah, the most merciful, the compassionate. And who would turn away from the community of Abraham?",
      "of Abraham except one who fools himself. We chose him in this world and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him, submit, he said I submit to the Lord of the worlds. And Ibrahim enjoined this upon his children as did Yaqub. O my children Allah has chosen",
      "the faith for you then die not except in submission Muslims so Ibrahim was the leader of humanity, Ibrahim is a father figure he's the great prophet of Allah. He was not the only prophet but he was a great prophet and he is the grandfather of prophets",
      "Ibrahim lived almost four thousand years ago and Allah's madad gave him Ishmael, and then after that gave him Isaac two children who were the prophets of Allah. So Ibrahim is a millah, milla is community,",
      "the religion, the faith is also called millah or you can say the community based on faith so that is the millah of Ibrahim and millah ibrahim is the middle that now you find that because the people the great prophets came in the community of Ibraheem that is Ismail",
      "Raghaba means that you like, and Raghab means you dislike.",
      "that Allah says except there's somebody who is a fool who is fooling himself accepting any other way except the way of coming through Ibrahim alaihissalam is not a wise thing it is a foolish thing because you will not be following the right path",
      "came with the community and he presented the message you know this the people who are living there in medina from the jewish community they said that we are with their people of Ibrahim alaihissalam say well this is what i'm saying who will do that i mean i am not going to turn away from them the way of Ibraheem alaihi salam i'm also",
      "وَمَنْ يَرْغَبُ عَمِّ لَّتِ إِبْرٰهِمَ إِلَّا مَن سَفِي نَفْسًا Only a fool will turn away from that community. The community of Ibrahim is well established, everybody knows that and we want to follow that, Muslims follow that. وَلَقَدْ اصْطَفَيْنَاهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا Allah said, We chose him in this world. Mustafa is the one who was chosen, selected. Selected for what? Selected",
      "for the leadership. So Allah chose him for leadership, to be the Imam, to guide for humanity. And in the Akhirah he will be among the righteous people. In this world he was chosen and selected, in the akhira he is among the people acceptable close to Allah.",
      "of his blood, because of his race, because he is color. Not because of anything it is because of Islam, because it's submission to Allah. So from Islam comes the word Aslim. Aslim is the command imperative. Allah told him Aslim submit or accept Islam take",
      "of Allah, of submission. And he said Aslamtul Rabbil Alameen I submit myself. I am a Muslim, I accepted that. Aslamtollirabbilalameen, I make my Islam, I made my submission to whom? To the Lord of the worlds, Lord of The Worlds, the Creator, the Master, Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, God Almighty",
      "So I submit to the Lord of the worlds. Allah told him do that and he immediately accepted that, and he submitted his whole life for Allah. Aslamtu wajhi ilayk wa fawwattu amri ilayh I submit my being to Allah. I accept Him as my Lord, as my Master.",
      "love him and I want to follow his message, his teaching. And this is the message Abraham gave to his children. So Abraham enjoined this upon his children, this was his Wasiyyah before he left this world, this",
      "and mentioned here only Yaqub because Yaquab had many children, 12 children. From these children came the tribes so here and from these 12 tribes there are people who claim themselves that they aren't followers of Ibrahim in the family of Yaquba that is Bani Israel. So Allah is reminding them, reminding Prophet Muhammad",
      "reminding the Muslims and reminding the people of from the children of Yaqub, Bani Israel as you mentioned before the Yaquab is one of the title of um Israel is the title",
      "for you, a faith for you. And that faith is Islam. فَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُ مُسْلِمُونَ So do not die except in Islam, in submission. That means your faith throughout your life until the end of your life must be Islam. لَا تمُوتٌّ إِلاَّ وَآتُمُسلمُ It's a very strong way of saying it. Of course nobody can stop that.",
      "And it did not say that you die, but it said that when you die When your death comes, you should be Muslim. And you cannot be Muslim at the point of death unless you have been Muslim throughout your life Or you have tried whenever you became aware of that then you accepted that. فَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلاَّ وَأَنتُ مُسْلِمُونَ and it's also mentioned here in Surah Al-Imran Allah says",
      "Or you who believe, have the Taqwa of Allah be mindful of Allah as you ought to be mindful Of Him and do not die except in submission Except as Muslims. So he also said that Ibrahim And then his grandson Yaqub",
      "they gave that wasiyyah, they got that guidance, that instruction and the guide and this instruction was to their children that you remain Muslims submit to Allah and be obedient to him throughout your life. So millah we mentioned, milla means community",
      "Ibrahim and his family were concerned about their children's faith and spirituality. That is, the good parents they are not just concerned about children's economic well-being physical well- being but they also must be concerned about Their Faith and about their spirituality so that's what they were doing and Yaqub is specially mentioned because of his relationship with Jews and Christians",
      "Christians. So previous major communities, Jews and Christians Quran reminds them that what was the message of Ibrahim? What was the method of Jacob? Peace be upon him. They both emphasize that their children and their community follow that and that is the millah of Ibraheem. That is a community of Ibrhaheem. And then furthermore we are reminded",
      "What are your witnesses? When death came to Jacob, Yaqub when he said to his children what will you worship after me they said we will worship your God and the god of your fathers Ibrahim Ismail and Isaac one God and to him they submit",
      "That is the community that passed away. For them, it's what they earn and for you, it is what you earn. And you shall not be questioned about what they used to do. So Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la is reminding people to remember that. This is something that you bring to your awareness. If you would have been there at the time of",
      "time of Yaqub's death, when he was on his deathbed during the last moment of his life. He called his children and his concern was not how are you going to live? How are you gonna make money? This and that all these worldly things no! The primary thing",
      "who are you going to worship what are you",
      "but what are you going to worship, O my children? So, O My Children! He asked them. And they said we are going to Worship your God and we are Going to Worship the God of Your Fathers. So he said to Yaqub, We are going To Worship Your God because You have been our Father and You have Been Our Example, You've Been Our Leader so we Are Going to",
      "the God whom you worship and the god of Ibrahim our father and Ismail and Isaac so grandfather is like father uncle is like Father Ismael was not their father Ismaeil was",
      "father was Ishaq and Ishaaq's brother was Isma'il so when the grandchildren of Ibrahim or the children of Yaqub were there in front of him he is telling them that your fathers, that means your ancestors",
      "all of them, who are they? your ancestors are those Ibrahim Ismail and Ishaq so they said",
      "Yaqub al-Islam wanted to know what the children are going to do. And he said, and they said, wa nahnu lahu muslimoon. And we are Muslims. And We are Muslims to whom? To Allah. Lahu ilah. Ilaha ila haka wailaha abayk. Your God and the God of your fathers. So we are Muslim's and we submit to him",
      "Allah said, That is the Ummah. That is a community of faith. So you have the word milla and now we have ummah. Milla and ummah they all these words are used in the Quran to emphasize a community",
      "that is the Ummah of Ibrahim, that is Ummah Ishaq and Yaqub. And these people passed away they left this world and they are going to receive the reward and the blessing according to what they did everybody's responsible for himself so they are",
      "their own righteousness. Allah says, for them, for their benefit is that which they earn. As we say, Allah SWT says, in the Quran, that for every soul is that what it earns and what it is against her what it turns. So here He says",
      "You will receive the reward according to your own deeds and they will receive their reward according what they did. And you are not going to be questioned about what your forefathers did, and your fore fathers are not gonna question what you did as long as they communicated the message, as long they have given you the guidance and helped you grow up as good Muslims whether you live that way or don't live that",
      "will not go to the forefathers, the blame will go to you. Every person is responsible for himself and herself. The Quran says no on the day of judgment no soul will take the burden of another soul every person will be questioned there will be question and will answer according to his or her deeds so it will",
      "لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَمَا اكْتَسبَتُ لَها مَن كَثَبتْ ولكن ما كَسبتمْ وِلا تُسْأَلُونَ عَنْ مَّا كُانُوا يَعْمَلونَ So, min la'af Ibrahim is Islam. This is what the Qur'an says. The Qur'ans say in chapter number 3 surah Al-Anirā'n ayat 19 إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِندَ اللَّهِ الْإِسْلَامُ The Deen in the sight of Allah or acceptable to Allah is Islam, it's submission",
      "submission. That is the deen throughout history, it is a universal Deen that started from the beginning of the history and will continue until then. The Deen, that is acceptable to Allah, Islam, submission to Allah SWT and also mentioned in the same Surah, Surat al-Imran Ayah number 85",
      "إذا أردت أن تبحث عن دين مخالف من المسلمين لن يكون هذا الحق فيه",
      "of Ibrahim. So Allah is mentioned through Prophet Muhammad to Muslim community that your father is Ibrahim, so Ibrahim alaihis salam is our father not necessarily biological father but spiritual father. So we are all the same faith and that is the leadership that is there Ibrahim",
      "and Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala called you Muslims before this, and before the Qur'an, and then also in the Qurán. Other books, messages of God, Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la were all the messages of submission to Allah.",
      "وقالوا كونوا هودا أو نصارى تهتدوا قل بل ملة إبراهيم حنيفا وما كان من المشركين",
      "They say, become Jew or Christian.",
      "you will be rightly guided. Say nay, rather Abraham swear he was a Hanif and he was not of the polytheists. Say we believe in Allah and that which was sent down to us and what was sent",
      "Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob and the descendants. And what was given to Musa and Isa, Mosul and Jisr. And What was given of other prophets from their Lord. We do not discriminate against any one of them. And to Allah we submit. So if they believe",
      "they are indeed rightly guided but if they turn away then it is they who are the indecension Allah will suffice you against them and He is all-hearing, all-knowing. So Jewish community they said become Jew the Christians had become Christian",
      "to become rightly guided. Islam says no follow the way of Ibrahim, go back to Ibrahim alaihi salam, the original, the one who was chosen by Allah and the one whose message was submission to Allah and he was, Ibrahim was Hanif. Hanif means straightforward non-deviant",
      "He was not the one who associated anyone with Allah in worship, in divinity. Ibrahim was according to Quran, Ibrahim alaihi salam was a pure monotheist. He did not mix up his monotheism with anything else. He didn't say there are two gods or three gods or many gods.",
      "there is only one God, and worship Allah, and submit to Him. So follow that community of the monotheists, a community of people who consider and recognize only one god. And if anybody is showing up to invite them, yes you can follow that. Then Allah gives us what is our belief? The belief of Muslims",
      "belief of Muslims. قولوا, it means O believers, O Muslims you say that! Say أَمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ We believe in Allah, our faith is in Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala وَمٰىٓ أُنزِلَ إِلٰيْنَا And we believe in that which was sent down to us, that means the Qur'an and that which",
      "and what was given to Musa and Isa. So we believe that is sent down to us, the Quran, and we also recognize the message of Ibrahim, Prophet Abraham, Prophet Ishmael, Prophet Isaac, Prophet Jacob, and Al-Asbaat, which means children, descendants, and the descendents of Yaqub.",
      "So Prophet Jacob had his descendants and these descendants were the twelve tribes, and among these tribes came many prophets. Allah says that these are the prophets that came among their descendants and whatever message they received from Allah will accept them. And then also great prophet Musa, Moses peace be upon him, and Jesus peace be",
      "for Islam is stand for in belief in Allah and the Quran and the teachings of great prophets of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. And other prophets, Lut alayhi salam, Sha'ib alayhis salaam, Hud alayhissalam, Salih alayis salaam those prophets who are not in the same direct line but they are great prophets",
      "We do not discriminate between one Prophet or the other Prophet. Discrimination means that is we do not say that we believe in one and we do Not believe in the other, we believe all of them. All the Prophets of Allah are mentioned by name, we Believe in them by name and those who are not mentioned By name, in general we believe",
      "We don't know all their names, but then 25 prophets are mentioned by name in the Qur'an. So we believe in all of them. لا نفرق بين أحد منه We do not say that is a prophet of Allah, but we don't accept it. We accept that, submit to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala recognizing all his messengers ونحن له مسلمون and we submit to Allaah",
      "Islam is not an exclusivist religion. Islam is the religion that includes the great messages of the prophets of Allah. That is the right faith, that is a true faith.",
      "Allah says if they believe that means people of other traditions, if they recognize this as you have recognized then they are rightly guided but if they turn away and they don't accept that then that means they are not they're separating themselves so you want to unite you want",
      "Allah will take care of that. So leave the judgment to Allah and Allah is sufficient for that. Allah hears and knows everything so it's not that something is not known to him, he hears what the people say and he knows what the People do. So, leave the final decision to Allah. But this is what you stand for",
      "So, we mentioned that Ibrahim means straight clean pure non-deviant and the Quran has used that word many times especially for Ibrahim",
      "And the Prophet Muhammad used to say, I am sent with a message that is straightforward. There's no deviation in this message. It's a straight forward message but at the same time it is very courteous. It is not harsh or stubborn and arrogant but soft",
      "and kind, and willing to talk to the people and dialogue with them. But it is Hanifiyyah, a straightforward message. So as far as the beliefs are concerned there is no compromise but at the same time good relations with others. And we believe in Asbaat, Asbaats means tribes and groups so many prophets who came among the descendants of Prophet Ibrahim",
      "Prophet Ibrahim, Isaac and Jacob especially the 12 tribes of Israel among them many prophets came we recognize all of them. And also in Islam we believe in all of these is the basic belief of Islam this is the Basic Message of Islam. Then we have another four very important verses that emphasize",
      "what should be the way. So Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says,",
      "on the hue of Allah and who is better than Allah in hue, and we are devoted to him. Say do you argue with us about Allah? Well he's our Lord and your Lord unto us are our deeds and unto you are your deeds and we",
      "descendants, what Jews or Christians say. Do you know more about Allah? Who is more unjust than him who conceals the testimony that he has from Allah? Allah is not unaware of what you do. That is a community that has passed away. This is what they earn and yours is",
      "be questioned about what they were doing. Sibghaat Allah, so it is not the color of any race, it is belonging to Allah. So if there is any sibghah, any way, any hue, any color in which you",
      "you put yourself that is connection to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala universal God. That is what Islam emphasizes and who is better than that? Whose color or whose hue, whose dye is better",
      "a saffron color or you have a yellow color, green color or red color whatever color the real color is the devotion to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala become the people of Allah. The Prophet Muhammad said",
      "on the day of judgment, on your faces and on your bodies. Your face, whether it is an Indian face, Pakistani face, Arab face, Chinese face, British face, American face, whatever! That is not what Allah is going to be concerned about. And also how much money you have. You are small",
      "small money or you have a lot of money this is not what Allah is going to pay attention to on the day of judgment but he will look at your a'mal and your hearts, your hearts were devoted to Allah and how are your actions behavior so سِبْغَةَ اللَّهُ مَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ اللّٰهِ صِبۡغًا that is the color that you should take",
      "should be devoted to Allah that if somebody sees you remember Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala these are the people of Allah. The Prophet said, Ahlullah is a rule to look at Allah when they are seen people remember Allah so wherever you are whatever do you do you move around and people will recognize these are",
      "the people of God, these are the godly people. These are the people in divine way. The whole personality is colored that way. Their personality, the way they talk and walk and move and give and take all of this is the way of Allah. And then Allah said to the people who came to argue with Muslims,",
      "Do you argue with us about Allah? There is no need to argue for that way. He's our Lord and your Lord, that's it! He's your God and our God. And we will be questioned about our deeds and you'll be question about your deeds. As far as we are concerned, we sincerely believe that way this is our ultimate",
      "ultimate position that to be sincere to Allah, devote yourself to Allah and this was the way of the previous prophets as well. Do you say that Ibrahim Ismail Saqeeh Qubb and their descendants they were Jews or Christians? I mean historically you know it was not because all the name Jews",
      "Not during the time of Ibrahim, Isma'il, Isaac and Yaqub. Did they say to their people become Jew or Christian? No, they said become the people of God. Submit to God. That's what they were saying. Do you know more than Allah?",
      "Who is more wrong than the one who conceals the testimony? The testimony is there in your books. You read those books and you know that what was the true message of the Prophet of Allah. And Allah knows very well what are you hiding and what you are revealing, what you're concealing and what",
      "This is the same point that was mentioned before so here it is repeated and the previous was in ayah number 134 and 140, same thing. That is you are prophets cannot be held responsible for what they",
      "their people do. So Sibgha is the coloring, the dye it is referring to the millah, the way and the community and that is not limited to a family but it is the colouring of God. Sibghat Allahi man ahsanu minallahi sibgha And the prophets cannot be called Jews or Christians because they lived before",
      "because these religions came afterward and the names were given afterward so that's why they cannot be called the jewish prophets or christian prophets because the name of the religion came after that so it's the religion what was their religion the same that came from the very beginning and that is submission to god islam and ayah is 141 uh is similar to i am about 134",
      "and that is, تِلْكَوْمَّةٌ غُدْخَلَتْ That is the community that has gone by. And they are going to be questioned about what their deeds and you will be question about your deeds and they will not be held responsible for what you do and you are not going to responsible for all of what they did. So everyone's going to give account of their own life. We pray to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala to bless us and help us understand",
      "send his message and follow it, communicate this message to the humanity. May Allah forgive us our mistakes, our shortcomings that is we are not presenting the message as it's supposed to be presented so may Allah bring us to the right path. Ameen Ya Rabbul Alameen So if you have any questions we can take some questions inshaAllah. BarakAllahu feekum",
      "We have few minutes. Thank you, thank you Dr Siddiqui. I hope you are doing well inshallah. We don't seem to have any questions at this time so just a quick reminder tomorrow at 8 pm ISOC Chairman Brother Hassan Habubati and Masjid President",
      "and this is a good opportunity for you all to hear the plans they will be sharing with you for Ramadan this year. You are all encouraged to join the conversation with any questions or concerns that you might have so watch out for the ISOC alert tomorrow to submit your questions ahead of time. And if we have no other questions, I wish you a very good afternoon. Thank you Darstiki, we'll join you in Dua'",
      "Allahumma, remove this virus from us. Will bring the humanity to the right path and protect all of us",
      "and help us to do good things bring peace and harmony in the world, peace and justice in the World. Allah remove the afflictions of all those who are afflicted, those who were not well Allah remove their suffering, their pain and those who passed away Allah forgive them have maqfara for them and give patience to their family members Allah remove our difficulties Allah forgive us Allah forgive"

      "Islam and Quran does that in many places to remind us so here we are reminded",
      "Say, O believers that we believe in Allah and whatever is revealed for us and whatever was revealed to Ibrahim",
      "Ibrahim Ismail is how the a coop and their tribes and whatever was given to Musa and Isa and whatever were given to all the prophets from their Lord and we do not make a discrimination between the prophets of Allah and we are submitting ourselves to him when I know who Muslim in submission so",
      "other people if they believe like you believe then they are rightly guided but if they turn away then they add in dispute their indecension and Allah will be sufficient for you for them and Allah the one who hears and knows everything",

      "Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala so that is the Dean and then a less one tell us his sip what Allah I want to talk few minutes about that sip what a law you know civilized is the color or die and it is there it is a it is",
      "because sometime you paint, you put a coat of color but it does not penetrate into the thing. The coat and the paint stays on the surface and it can be scratched but Sivagha is something that penetrates into the object that you color. That's called Sivgha.",
      "color and you take that color so what is Islam? That is Islam the Deen, the Iman should penetrate into your being it is not over the surface. It is not like a paint but it is something that colors your whole personality. That's what the real iman is. The iman goes inside the heart",
      "your inward and outward, your private and your public every aspect of your life is covered and colored by Islam. And that is the coloration of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala Sifghaatallah that means every believer must be colored by this color of Allah subhana wata'ala but color of",
      "color of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is not black color of Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la is not brown Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta'ala Is beyond that he's the creator of all the colors but there is no special color of ALLAH recently I was hearing a Christian priest mentioning that he was in his church in his study room and his daughter visited him young",
      "around and she was looking at the pictures on the walls of the church paintings on the wall of the Church and she saw one picture and he explained to her that this is Jesus with his disciples on the Last Supper so she very quick very carefully she looked at that and she said to him but none",
      "he said jesus and all these none of them look like us so that is a problem when you take picture you make a picture of a particular thing and that you make allah subhanaw ta'ala you make him into that color so some people paint god as white some people",
      "something else and this is what creates all kind of issues problems difficulties theology as well as in the practical life that's why Islam says no way no image no major image of Allah and no image of the prophets of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala don't make any image and a lie especially prophet were of course are human beings but Allah swt is beyond that",
      "so Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala when we say isif what Allah the color does not mean the white color of black color colors means a character correct me is that but the being as it's Alice vanilla being is Imam Ghazali Rahmallah he wrote a whole book explaining the names of Allah swan and our beautiful names of",

Islam is a religion of akhlaaq, the manners that are highly emphasized in Islam and of course Islam also has certain rules and regulations sharia all of these things and the hadith of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam emphasizes at this point he said",

      "As-salamu alaykum. On behalf of the Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago, the CIOGC, our co-host Downtown Islamic Center and our sponsor Dr. Muzaffar Mirza & Associates I welcome you to today's Ramadan Nightly Quranic Tafsir Session My name is Salman Azam",
      "Azam. I am an executive board member and the secretary at Downtown Islamic Center Chicago, and I have the pleasure of being your host this evening as we embark on the precious last 10 nights of Ramadan. All month long, we have been blessed with various knowledgeable scholars from across Chicagoland but tonight we are lucky enough to be joined by one of the true pioneers and the leaders of the Muslim community in America coming to us all the way from California is none other than Dr. Muzammil Siddiqui.",
      "Muzaamil received his early education at Aligarh University and Darul Ulum in India. He has also gotten advanced degrees from Islamic University of Medina and Harvard University. I've had the honor of working with him at the Islamic Society of North America where he served as president from 1996 to 2000. He is the current chairman of the FIC Council of North American and remains synonymous with the Muslim community in Southern California,",
      "County, because before I was even born. Alhamdulillah, Dr. Muzammil has widely traveled and has lectured at universities, colleges, and other Islamic academic and religious institutions in over 28 countries, many times right here in Chicago. He is also a professor at Chapman University and involved in various interfaith activities across the globe. Inshallah, in tonight's program, Dr., Muzamal will give us highlights of Quranic guidance from Surahs 83 to 88 that",
      "There is Surah Al-Mutaffafin, Al-Inshiqaq, Al Buruj, Surat Tariq as well as other suras you hear a lot of on Jummahs, Eids and other occasions. Suratul Ala and Surat al Ghashiyya After the abridged tafsir we will have a Q&A session where you will get an opportunity to ask your question Please send your questions through the chat portal of the website Tonight since we are blessed with Dr Muzammal Siddiqui who's an expert on fiqh in addition to questions regarding his presentation today",
      "I bless all of you Ramadan Mubarak Inshallah we'll have a short study, a brief study of six surahs",
      "six Surahs. I don't call it Tafseer, It will be just some reflections on some Ayat from these Suras. We have six Suras starting with the Sura number 83 and until Sura 88 so I am going to do three things first",
      "a general view of all these Surahs. Then after that I will give a brief summary of each Surah and then after that take some ayat, some passages from each Suruh and reflect on them and insha Allah try to finish everything in half an hour. So overall view",
      "These six surahs, they are all Makki Suras. They were revealed to the Prophet while he was in Mecca and most probably in the early period of his work. All of these surah emphasize the day of judgment. The ultimate decision will be made on that day based on the record of every person's faith and action.",
      "their Iman and their Amal. And on the basis of that, the decision will be made. Surahs give you some kind of an argument that the Day of Judgment should take place and will take place. The nature points to the Day Of Judgment that will happen. The history testifies that it must happen. Also, it says that there will be some cataclysmic events",
      "that will take place when that day will come. Human beings should not deceive themselves, ignoring that day. Those who do evil they should not think that they will escape the judgment of Allah. So these are the themes that we see throughout these six surahs. The first surah is Surah number 83, Surat al-Mutaffifin",
      "The surah warns those who commit fraud in business. means giving less and so it reminds that people should do honest dealings the righteous will prosper",
      "Allah has the record of every person. So, every person has his own record. Some people's record will be in the lowest of the low, in the sijjeen and some people's records will be at the highest of the high, in illi jeen. So Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala mentioned those whose record will lie in the low place and those whose records will lie on the high place. Then we have Surah Al-Inshqaq",
      "It has 25 verses. It tells us that this world has no permanence. Allah will split the thunder, the sky and earth will be straight out and everything will be done. Everything will be gone.",
      "and the reward of the righteous, and the punishment of the wicked. It reminds people to pay attention to the message of the Quran. Surah 85, surat al-Buruj speaks about the persecution of the believer that happened in history. And Allah is watching everything it says that. Allah is",
      "may not come immediately but it will come those who commit injustice and oppression will be brought to judgment the surah warns the opponents of this message their end might be the same as that of the many nations before who denied and they denied allah's message and persecuted the believers then",
      "Then next slide. Let we have Surah Tariq, Surah number 86.",
      "The creation is a serious work of Allah and so is His word, the Quran. And those who plan and plot against it, Allah will deal with them but He's giving them respite that is they are فَمَهِّلُ الْكَافِرُونَ مِحْلٌ رُوَيْدًا So give time to those and Allah is giving them time that is",
      "back to Allah. Surah number 87, suratul a'la speaks about the praise of Allah, the highest. He created everything. He has power to recreate. The Quran is the message from Allah and he will guard it. The Prophet should continue reminding people those who accept will benefit from it but those who reject",
      "those who reject they will be the losers and this message is the same as was given to earlier prophets such as prophet Ibrahim and Prophet Musa alaihimussalam and then we have the last surah that we'll be discussing is Suratul Ghashiyyah. The surah talks about the coming calamity",
      "that which will cover and the humanity will be divided into two groups those who will be frightened tired and exhausted and those who would be joyful and happy then their attention is drawn to this wonderful world that Allah has created various animals, camel and then the heaven and the mountains and all of these are mentioned there",
      "and the Prophet is told to remind people his mission is to remind only not to impose the message and Allah will make the final judgment so these are basic I mean a summary of the surah now we are taking some passages from the Surahs",
      "they are very important passages, but they do not necessarily mean that they are the central themes of the surah. Surat al-Muthafifin, the first surah that we started, surah number 83, it starts with",
      "Go to those who cheat. Those when they take measure from people, they demand it full. But when they measure our way for people, They give less. Do they not think that they will be resurrected on a tremendous day? The day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds",
      "Now, Tatkheef from which comes the word Mutaffif. Mutaffi is a person who does not give full measure, who cheats and short measures. And Allah says that these people when they give to people, when they measure for the people, that means when they are selling, they give less but when",
      "or chase things for themselves then they want to have full measure so when they take major from people they demand it full and when they measure our way for other people they give less so this is uh i mean deception they deceive people",
      "and then also they have a double standard one for themselves and another for others. And it is mentioned that this was happening in Mecca or in Medina there's some business people were doing that the great warning came and it is",
      "this message, they were always after they sell something, they will increase. They will give a little more because they become conscious of that. Imam Malik in his Muwatta says Everything that you do, you can either fulfill or you shortchange.",
      "short change. Short-chain can take place in business, it can take places in family relations, it takes place in dealing with other people, employers and employees, it could take place politically or even in international relations. This is the very unfortunate thing that we see",
      "thing that we see here, people have double standards. Sometimes husband and wife, husband wants something from the wife and he wants that she should do this or she should to do that but he himself does not look at his own behavior and this is TATVIF.",
      "that employee should come on time, he should do the job, you should do this and this but when it comes to paying the wages is not giving full wages. He's not treating him well or the other way the employee want that full rights but it does not do the jobs for the employer. Countries, politicians, leaders they",
      "that they have the right over everybody else so everybody must do what they're supposed to do but they themselves don't do it and people abuse united nations other international bodies they use that so this is you find that it goes on and this double standard is deception,",
      "a lot of problems. So Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala reminds us that be not of those kind of people. Those people, do they not think that they are going to be resurrected and they're going to give the account of their life? If so, those who have belief in the Akhirah, they should not do that. Now this is a very interesting thing.",
      "When they take measure, they'll take it full. That means they know that what is right. They know what is justice because they demand it for themselves. It is not that they are doing injustice because they don't do it but they keep double standard one for themselves and for others. And so the surah goes on with that way",
      "And then mentions there's those who believe in Allah, they will fulfill their responsibilities. And the Prophet is there to remind them and on the Day of Judgment in the end Surah says that those who have done wrong, they've been laughing at the believers and ridiculing them but on the day of judgment it is the",
      "the believers who will laugh at those people because they did not pay attention to the reminders of the Prophet. Let's go to second Surah Al-Inshiqaq begins with the cataclysmic event that is going to take place, Samam Shaqat then when the sky will rip asunder Mu'adhinat li Rabbih wa Huqqat",
      "And it will listen to its Lord. And it has the right to do that. It must do that and the earth is going to be stretched out, and it's going to throw out everything that is inside. And also the Earth has to do this, listen to his Lord.",
      "man, O human being you are toiling towards your Lord and you shall meet him. Whatever you do whatever we do we are slowly moving towards meeting our Lord. A day will come when we'll be there and we'll meet our Lord and then Allah says",
      "Those whose record will be in their right hand, they shall have easy reckoning. They will not be asked too many questions. They'll have the Hisaab and it will be very quick Hisaaab. Easy Hisaaaab. And he shall return to his people happy because",
      "because he will see that Allah has taken his Hesab easy and the end will be good, and the result will be Good. But then next slide",
      "As for him who is given his book from behind his back, he will cry out for destruction. And he shall burn and he shall",
      "Nay, indeed his Lord has been watching him. So the one who is giving his record behind the back let's say back up on that though the one whose given his record from behind his back is the one knew this his record was not going to be good so he was putting his hand back and whether you put your hand in front or you put it your hand",
      "Every person's record will be given to that person. So he will be giving his record from behind, from his back and when he will see that he'll say I wish I was not there.",
      "he returned to the hellfire. And in the hell fire, he neither live nor die. He was not concerned about the Day of Judgment. He wasn't doing anything right but he was just enjoying his life and he was not even reminding his family. The believers are mentioned in the Quran",
      "were concerned in our family we were living our life that is thinking about that what is going to happen how you do things of course you should be you enjoy your family be happy but at the same time don't forget the last day he thought it's not going to return there will be no no come going back to allah there is no giving the account",
      "Allah is watching everybody. So this is a very important point that we get from this surah, Surat al-Inshiqaq. Of course the Quran mentions these points again in different places, different ways. Let's look at the next slide that comes from Surat Al-Buruj where Allah SWT mentions the Ashab al-Khudud, the people of the ditches who are persecuting the believers",
      "And there are many people who do that. Oppressors and people who doing injustice and do wrong to the people of faith. Then Allah says, Truly your Lord's grip is very severe. He it is who originated",
      "is who originates and he will bring back. He's the most forgiving, the most loving. The possessor of the throne, the glorious. Glorious is the title of the Lord because it's called Dhul Arshi Majeedu. So possessor",
      "the doer of whatever he wills. So Allah is the one who brought everything but his grip is very strong nobody can escape the grip of Allah, but at the same time He is Ghafoor those who repent He's most forgiving Al-Wadud he does not hate His creation actually he loves His creation",
      "To succeed. He wants them to be in the Jannah. Al-Wadud. Wadud is a very strong term for love. For who is Ghafoor? Al-Badood. He's the most forgiving, the most loving. Dhul Arsh. Al Majeed. And he controls the throne. That means everything is under his authority, under his power. And here's the one and should not sin against him.",
      "against him, one should not disobey Him. And He has power to do everything. So Surah Al-Buruj is reminding us about that the love and forgiveness of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala but at the same time His strong grip and he has power",
      "By the sky and that which comes by night. And what will make you realize what is that which",
      "And the oath of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala means that he is bringing these things to testimony. So look at the sky and At-Tariq is that which comes during the night. Some people say it is a particular star, whether it is Saturn or some other stars, this is a particularly star.",
      "to do what is Tariq, what that nightcomer is? Najm-us Sa'aqid. The piercing star the shining star. The shining stars not necessarily one star but many stars all the stars and billions of stars",
      "them and fixed them in different places. Imagine his power, his knowledge, his creativity and he is the one who created human beings. Every soul there is a watcher over that soul. Allah has appointed watchers and He's the watcher of all the watchers. He is the great Hafiz.",
      "And then after that it says, so let a person think about how he came into being and what will happen to him. So this is the beginning of the surah emphasizes the power and majesty of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Let's move to",
      "Suhuf al-Ula, Suhf Ibrahim and Musa. In Surah Al-A'la Allah says he is indeed successful who purifies himself remembering the name of his Lord and then prays but you prefer the life of this world while the hereafter is better and more lasting truly this is in the earlier scriptures that scriptures are Ibrahim",
      "Musa. So that is the real point, that Allah you praise him is great and finally the message comes through his prophets and those who purify themselves follow the way of Allah they are the ones who are going to be successful and they pray",
      "allah and then prayer and pray but there are people who prefer this life and think that this life is the real life Allah says the life that is going to come that is better and that is more lasting the life of this world is for a short life",
      "by all the prophets and messengers. And mentioned especially the scripture that was given to Ibrahim alayhis salam and Musa alayhi salam. And then we have the surah number 88. Next slide.",
      "So remind. You are only a reminder. You're not there to compel them. As for him who turns away from and disbelieves, Allah shall punish him with the major punishment. Surely to us is their return and then surely to us",
      "came to remind and the last prophet especially Prophet Muhammad may peace and blessings be upon him and upon all the prophets of Allah they were reminders there is no compulsion in religion but those who follow they will receive the blessing of Allah and those who turn away they",
      "we are all going to go back to him and he is going to take account of everyone. May Allah make our accounting easy and may Allah bless us in this life and in the life to come and remove all the difficulties and problems from us especially the problem that we are facing today. May",
      "from that and bring the humanity to the right path. May Allah help us to understand his message and follow it.",
      "you so eloquently summarized all those surahs in such a short time. We're so honored to have you here addressing your Chicago community. It's been a while since you've been here and we look forward to having you back. In the next couple of moments, I'll address some of the questions that came from our audience. The first one I think deals maybe with our first surah when we were talking about business dealings this question says is an interest bearing law",
      "an interest bearing loan announced by the US government under the CARES Act permissible according to Sharia? This is a loan. Actually, it is a grant from the government to help small businesses to take care of their employees because",
      "many businesses are closed and they do not have enough funds so may they lay off people and when the layoff people it will be a burden of the government also uh they have to pay them their unemployment and all these things so government for this reason he came up with this idea that those companies",
      "if people fulfill the purpose of the loan that means they take care of their employees and whatever their taxes other things that are there they will repay then this loan will be forgiven and and then it will become a grant but if people do not do that then they have to pay back",
      "America. We discussed that and we say it is though it is called a loan but actually, it is the grant and it is to be taken with several conditions one of them is that it should be taken only for the purpose for which is given back on it should",
      "they do not incur any interest on it. It is like you use your credit card, if you use a credit card just to take the convenience of using a creditcard but as soon as you receive the bill you pay and you don't incur any interests then nothing wrong in using the credit card. Exactly. If you pay interest",
      "Haram to do that and one should not do that. I like the comparison with the grants when shall life we can use it under The grant guidelines, it is permissible in show Thank you. I have another question that probably takes on some of your FIC expertise The question from the audience today now comes will non-muslims who never got exposed to other Muslims or the Quran be punished equally as those Who knew Muslims and the Quran but did not eat at all",
      "Allah knows everybody's heart and Allah knows what excuses people will have whether the non-Muslims did not believe because they did not get the message or they got very bad examples from Muslims. Muslim did not really show them the good example, they were not good role models",
      "or they got the information from people who hate Islam and misrepresent Islam. All of these things are to the knowledge of Allah. Allah says in the Quran, We shall not punish anyone until we send a messenger. And sending a messenger means that conveying the message. The message should come clearly to the people",
      "have to al-balaq the clear career message to be given if somebody did not receive the career method if somebody received also the bad example and the bad uh thing that they saw that people were doing then allah has is kind and merciful he will not punish people simply because they did not change dr mizamil i um you know the chicago",
      "Muslim congregants have listened to our call to close masjids during this pandemic. The council has advised all of its member constituents to do so, but because they have you here the question did come up and they wanted you to address what is the basis for masjid closures during emergencies like the one we have now and the one that we have put in place? You see that this virus as much as I learned about it",
      "learned about it and some people know more this is a very strange kind of virus you may not know that you are getting the virus from somebody because it's it may appear after a week or two weeks so infection is very easy and people can convey they infect others",
      "But disinfectant is not very easy to have them. Especially in our massages, people go they pray next to each other make sajda, make ruku and all of these things that is possibilities are there much more. So we have to protect people this epidemic is growing and a lot of people are dying and a",
      "sick. So it is important to protect yourself so when you have a disease spreading then it is that for people should be protected uh when there is some something that will harm the people, it is allowed that people should pray at home. Yes, it's mentioned that at the time of rain, it was said that",
      "places in your own homes and those who are sick they should not be next to those who",
      "Prayer is very important, but at the same time, the protection of life is also very important. And for this reason, temporarily massages are closed. It happened also in the past when there were plagues in some areas, it is mentioned by Imam Ibn Hajar and others that the massages were closed in the area in Egypt or in Syria",
      "is not be communicated to others so that is the reason and i hope inshallah that these restrictions will be eased and people will be able to go back i mean it will not come immediately it will take time it may take certain phases uh some in some areas",
      "Ameen. May Allah give us common clues to restart our business, inshallah. Because we have you again for FIC questions, we're getting questions very different from the days that we've gotten so far. The most recent question that I'm going to pose to you is that the audience members wanted to know, is the Taliban ideology a form of Islamic law? Any time when people...",
      "Our religion does not teach extremism. Our religion is the religion of moderation. The purity of the religion and graciousness in the religion, that is what religion teaches. When people take certain views and they think these are their only views and I'm right and everybody else is wrong",
      "that is not the right approach so ideology of extremism, ideology of radicalism and then from there comes also the violence all of these things they do not belong to Islamic teachings. Islamic teachings are the teachings of justice and truth but at",
      "whatever organization is there the organization has to live by that our prophet Muhammad peace and rest of allah be upon him he was a mercy to the world",
      "extremism has to be avoided. JazakAllah I have time for one more question and it's a very corona social isolation question we are all homebound now how can we increase our relationship with Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala and also how can make our relationship",
      "and pray in home with the family together, jama'ah prayers. Read the Quran together. Talk to each other and remind them and make dua together. Ask Allah SWT to bless us and protect us. Allahumma afizna min kulli bala. Allahuma smizna bin kulli baba. Allahummah afiznaya wa auladana min kullin bala.",
      "you know the beautiful dua of the prophet from uh afflictions and uh from misfortunes so we should pray together this is a great opportunity to do that with the family and let our family feel that nobody should feel like frightened and scared and depressed but rather",
      "rather working and then also relationship should be good with the family members spouses should uh should care for each other because this is a time of difficulty and loving relationship will make this going this time will go away easy and people will feel alhamdulillah we had a good time too that we were together so consider that allah has given you the opportunity that you have nice home",
      "have nice home where you can sit and you can eat, and you enjoy your family. Thank you to Allah. And inshaAllah it will pass. It will pass but good relations are very important. Good relation with spouses. That is good to hear. I think a lot of us are getting a lot more time with our spouses than we have ever had. And Alhamdulillah, it's during the month of Ramadan so that is good. Everybody is taking advantage of like almost a staycation",
      "become closer to Allah. I feel the distance from each other, inshallah is lessening the distance between us and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala in this situation. Yes, that's very important very important to do that. I'm told we have time for one more question because it came more than once in the chat a lot of us take it for granted this year you know we were not able to do tarawih prayers nightly people are feeling quite a void and I saw this question more than",
      "The question is, is Tarawih mandatory?",
      "that he did not do that although people were there waiting for him but he said I will not do so it will not become obligatory upon you and then it will find it very hard. So, he prayed himself. He prayed himself and the Sahaba they used to pray but not everybody was not coming to the masjid to pray and for some time they prayed even separate",
      "and until the time of Umar he saw that people are praying in different places so yes it will be good if you all come together and pray behind one Imam. So that is the history of Tarawih prayer. So Tarawif prayer, you can pray in the masjid, it's wonderful to come to the masjed and listen to the Quran and have a Fafaz reciting the Quran It creates great atmosphere but it is not obligatory",
      "this situation uh we pray at home pray at if somebody is knows the quran more that let that person be the imam of that person to lead the prayer uh if you know only some short surahs recite short suras whatever you can you can pray that and it is also permissible according",
      "to have the copy of the Qur'an in your hand and read from the copy. So it is, you can do Tarawih at home. JazakAllah. Dr. Mousam, we're coming to the close of our time here. It's truly an honor for me to be hosting you like this. I don't think I, last time I did this was, I think you and I were on a planned charitable giving seminar at ISNA. And ISNA is returning to Chicago inshallah.",
      "We hope to see you back here for ISNA, if not sooner. From the bottom of our heart we appreciate you taking time to address our Chicago community this evening. It was a special treat as we head into the last 10 days of this blessed month. I want to thank all of our audience for tuning in to CIOGC's daily Ramadan Tafsir and once again we thank our co-hosts at the downtown Islamic Center and our sponsor Dr. Muzaffar Mirza and associates",
      "Tomorrow, we have Shaykh Amin Khawadiyah and who will cover Surahs 89 to 114. That's Surah Al-Fajr all the way down to Anas. And inshallah with a dua to follow on Friday. We hope you all have enjoyed this session. We thank again Dr. Muzamil Siddiqui to come to us all the from California. And we hope you'll all have a blessed iftar with your families. Ramadan is short.

Just a reminder, right after the sunnah inshallah ta'ala we have our own Dr. Siddiqui will be going over a presentation of hajj or call it virtual tour of hajdj. Going over the significance of some of the places where the hujjaj go to in the rituals of hajm why do they perform it?",
      "mind it too fast that day if you can and there's going to be an iftar here at the masjid i'll be five dollars per person for the iftar so please participate in that salam alaikum",
      "If the sisters would like to sit in the main hall,",
      "in the main hall so you could see the powerpoint um there'll be some sister be some chairs put in the corner for you all because of the powerpoints the projectors on one side of the room we have to move the brothers over a little bit so my apologies for that",
      "was so happy human voila so as you know that haji is the pillar of Islam it is one of the obligations for those who can afford it and Hajj is performed at a I mean there are certain rules of height that were given to us by the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam according",
      "time in a particular place and a particular way it is you can visit Makkah at any time that will not be Hajj but it has to be al-hajjo shroom Aluma you have to go into the months of Hajj and perform the heads at the time of height and it is performed in Mecca and its surroundings you cannot go to any other place you",
      "and you know is very important but Hajj is not in Medina haji's in Mecca and its surrounding area and Haji is certain rules certain regulations I'm not going to talk about the rules and regulations of Hajj inshallah when you go to high Jail talk about that at that time we can give you a more detailed itinerary of height how do what I'm going",
      "And this is, these are the places called Mecca, Mina, Arafat, Muldalifah and then Mina. So first thing you know that Hajj is a very ancient tradition. Hajj was not started by the Prophet. It is started by Ibrahim, and Ibrahim was in 2100 BC",
      "that means 2100 years 1900 years before I saw a cell and between Bahamas or Salaam and is our 600 years so that we 2500 years so 2500 years before Rasulullah sallallaahu alaihi wasalam hadji started and now for 1500 years of past it's like 4000 years old tradition so it's one of the oldest tradition of pilgrimage",
      "that you have that and had just performed first of all in Mecca and Makkah is the oldest place on this earth or this place when Allah swt made the heaven and the earth before he created human beings Allah swant Allah sent down",
      "so car was not built by Ibrahim alayhi salam it was rebuilt by Brian Melissa Carver was built by the angels of Allah swt even before Adam alaihissalam came to the earth and that's why last one that I said in a wall abating what are you alina slalom be Bucca and my God many names one of the names is Makkah mentioned in the Quran surah al-fatih",
      "other name for Makkah is makka means a place of gathering and people gather in line number another name of Makkah Bakka",
      "One of the names of Mecca is Al-Balad al-Amin. That is safe, sacred city. That's the name of Meccan. And Mecca also mentioned in the Bible. It is called Faran or the wilderness of Paran. In the book of Exodus and other places you have that.",
      "so it is mentioned It is as I said, it's the oldest place So this was for a long time and then Carver was there And Various generations of past and Then came came the time of Noah. He's Salaam No, her Salaah was probably 400 years before Ibrahim alayhi salam",
      "So no Halle Salam came in the area that is Today you have Syria and Turkey around that area And he preached a message for 900 years 950 years But not too many people accepted him so he prayed to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to destroy the people The flood came and this flood was all over",
      "came it also came to Mecca then there are two traditions one tradition says that at the time of the flood Kaaba was destroyed because of the Flood another tradition said a last month I sent the angels and they lifted the Kaaba up and Kaaba",
      "after Noah came Ibrahim and you know the story of Ibrahim he was sent to the area that is now known as Jerusalem and they can on and he went to Egypt and all of this he was born in Iraq or and then you travel and he was in the western part of Palestine",
      "and Allah said to him, take your wife and your son to a place, to a valley. And this valley is southern valley, the valley of Paran, the Valley of Parn, Valley of Mecca. So he came and brought his wife Hajra and his son Ismail and settled them there. At that time it was nothing so he said",
      "I brought my family here in a valley that has no vegetables, no cultivation because Makkah is dry land. There was nothing in that area at the time so he brought the family there and he left the family and then his you know their story that Ismail's mother was looking for water",
      "water there was no water there so she went ran between Safa and Marwa in Chalot talk about that so she ran between safar marwah and then she saw suddenly that the water was bubbling from the feet of his smile as she came to system them some so that is some some but there was water and here's the family and then other people saw",
      "can we be here? Can you stay here?\" She said, yes but water belong to me. It's not that you take over the water. They say yeah, you can drink water but now you cannot own it. So they stayed there and this is the way how Ismail grew up in that. And later Ibrahim came and Ibrahim and Ismael both of them built a Kaaba.",
      "place where the Kaaba was at the time of Adam alayhi salam way but what now Abraham a McConnell bait and that to speak be Shia we showed him the place of the house so it was in that place that Ibrahim Alislam built the house it was a small house that you primary son I'm built and this house remained for long time other people came after",
      "They built and rebuilt and did some Repairs, and it continued like that until the time of Rasulullah sallallaahu in the sixth century of the common era so Mecca started growing still to a small town and Ibrahim alayhi salam prayed for the city of Makkah in two places. He mentioned that in one place he said the city was not there",
      "city was not there so that we all have a bulletin Amina well I make this a safe City so it was not a city so he's prayed to Allah swt the bulletin in Surat Ibrahim is a rabbit or Hazel Bella de Amina no there is a difference between one and the other when I once oh one reference is when",
      "make this city safe and the first say I make this as a safe City that means it is not there to make this a safe city in the other one he said make this City safe and so Allah SWT help that city grow and more and more people were living there and this the Kaaba was established",
      "last one that I told Rahim alayh salam that he saw in his dream that he was sacrificing something that is most beloved to him and he interpreted that this was his son so he spoke to his son he said yeah when a year any Allah film an arm my son I saw in my dream that I am sacrificing you so what is your opinion and the Sun were agreeing is it do whatever is",
      "Ibrahim alaihissalam took his son for the sacrifice but as he was almost going to to sacrifice him call came from a last one that's not dr. oh yeah stop you have fulfilled what you saw in your dream in Nika Valley can is del most serene before they know who visit me now Zima last month Allah gave him a lamb and he put",
      "When we have the Eid al-Adha on Sunday, that is a tradition of that. So you have this story of the city of Mecca. The city of Makkah is called Umm Al Quraa. This is the mother of the cities. One of their names also is mentioned in the Quran, Umm Al Qurraa and Kaaba is Al Bayt Al Ateeq. Kaaba means the old house and this old house is the house for the worship of Allah SWT",
      "Now Arabs Even though they honored Ibrahim alayhi salam and they loved him, but they forgot his message of Tauhid I Love so in the beginning were people of tori. They only believe in one God But slowly they forgot that message and the shirk came among them And there is a story about this Historians scholars have written about it how shit came on among them? So they became mushy king",
      "and they started worshiping many gods a lot in our zone manat and hovel and all of these gods and goddesses that they had and Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam came and tell them that you go back to religion of your father Ibrahim Alayhi Salam Mila tabiq um Ibrahim it is your father for him we follow that and don't brew the shake and he preached there was a message of Tauhid",
      "and but what happened that Kaaba at the time was full of idols it's Kaaba that was established as a place of worship of one God that was then by Ibrahim alaihissalam in his son Ismail islam slowly they started bringing idols inside the Kaaba idols and idols and ideas so some stories say there were 360 idols each tribe had its own idol there like United Nation of idols",
      "and the Sula Salaam came to start preaching the message of tawhid and he told them this is not the way of Ibrahim alayhi salam made him the prophet at the age of 40 it's either preaching the West and we did that 13 years and they became against him and they wanted to kill him so he migrated from Mecca to Medina",
      "took place between the Meccans and the people of Medina and alhamdulillah the Prophet was successful in defeating the enemies and then he came back to Makkah and recaptured Makkah I just called for trucker after the first Makkah actually it is before that that Allah subhanallah made obligatory upon the people to make Hajj the Hajj was there but Alice wanted",
      "became obligatory the Prophet did not go there because still Makkah was under the control of the pagans and other control of The Horaish so he did not do but some people learned there and later after first Mecca also he sent Ali radiallahu anhu and some others but one in the tenth year of hijrah as I was mentioning today in the hood bar the tenth",
      "how to perform the hajj now let me go back to the Kaaba Kaaba is known today as it is a more of bar huh it is quiet but actually I'm did not make it that way even the time of Rahim s alarm it was long and one direction",
      "there was a lady brought some perfume and she was burning some perfume inside the Kaaba it caught fire so there were some part of us damaged and then flood came and flood destroyed some more part so the Meccans decided to build the rebuilt the cover at that time the process love was about 35 year old",
      "raising the foundation the walls there is a place came where you have to put the higher as what had our sword was given to Ibrahim alayhisselam ibrahima lissana which came from Jannah and the process said it was white but he became black because of the sins of the human being so hadir Aswad known as has her ass with now",
      "Ibrahim al-islam put it in one of the walls actually there are two stones very historic a stone one is hadja as well like a strong and the other is McCombie brahim McCombia brahima's also from muck from from Jannah yeah cool tatami mean Yahoo men you're walking till Jenna the process of sending one of dahadith these are the two jewels on the Jewels of paradise so if Rahim",
      "stone and this is torn will go up at the bridge and the wall was going up and son Ismael would give him the stones they said when a brick by brick he was putting there and whenever he had to speak used his face stand on that and he was standing on that stone when he made the announcement for Hodge and our footprints of",
      "Ibrahim so there is Rukun and it is McComb Rookin is place of Haji Aswad McComb is the place of the stone of your I him a nice salam it was very close to cover still there but now it is covered with a crystal covering so if you can look at it you can see this tone there and you can",
      "that's a Kaaba and on this side is the higher as well this is the door of the Kaaba",
      "so people can see that of course you are not supposed to kiss it like how the asphalt you're not supposed do anything just what you can look at it is a great historic thing for a thousand year apart and this is from a stone from their stones of paradise so this is called McComb Ibrahim and these are you can see there the steps up Ibrahim alayhissalaam yeah prints of his steps",
      "So Ibrahim alayhis salaam He built the Kaaba and to mention that it was in the time of Ismail Alayhi Salaam that he they started putting the kiss wah the covering of the cover The coating of the copper was not always black sometimes. It was covered with white Sometimes were covered with green Sometime it was covered red Then later during those money period",
      "period it became black coating and now it's always black covering so you see that this not that Kaaba is always covered with black it was black and all those things so you have that yeah this is the covering and this covering is changed once a year now which used to be change two or three times",
      "There is a factory in Mecca where this cover is prepared the covers now kiss you ah It used to be until 1972 it used to come from Egypt But then there was a problem between Saudi Arabia and Egypt So it was decided by King Faisal that we are not going to have Kiswah from Egypt We are going to make it our own so they established a factory and started making their own kiss wah",
      "your own kiss wah and now the kiss wise from there from there this is expensive it's a lot of gold and a lot silk and all of these things are there and then every year it is changed and then they cut into pieces and give it to for judge some of the dignitaries become some diplomats and others our scholars and all Emma they receive part of it I still I have a part",
      "sometimes they take it to their homes and put it and the same thing is also this covering of the door of the Kaaba this is all the given to various massages you have yet much drama in Los Angeles they have a coding of there okay the real covering not something that isn't made which is the real coloring you have them so covering up the cover is also very important",
      "and so this is really a lot of history you have that then you also have the haram haram is the mosque that was built around the kaaba and this is the largest mosque in the world and this mosque has been people were expanding it expanding it expending it",
      "people can pray inside inside two million people and it has several floors and matthoff is the area of Tava Mattaf is also become very large and almost hundred thousand people can make the off at the same time so in every year I'm every hour almost 100,000 people make the love and there are three levels of the",
      "is done on the second floor and top is down on the top floor so the wafts they are there and then they also some some the symptom that was there because that's what only well and people really don't know what is the source from where this water come thousands and thousands of gallons of water every day it's coming",
      "and people try to it's not very deep and It used to be a well they used to draw the from the bucket I remember in 62 when I went there as a student at that time we used to have buckets and I drew the water from there and drink it so you could see the well now You don't see the value to know on the ground, and they had it in the ground for some time People go by steps and under and see it and drink the water But now it's totally covered. So only thing that you see is",
      "only thing that you see it is the water is by by them well all right so this is the old now you don't have it dead you can go underneath and just see that and you could see that well and there was some faucet from where the water come and people would make voodoo and drink it but now it's not no more they're",
      "different places and it's all over the harem they put jars of water some of them are cool by ice cold and some of the regular temperature and this is these are the jars from where you can have it to have plastic cups use cups clean cups all of this we have that so",
      "Take the water. The water is outside of the harem also. People fill their jars and take it home, or they wash their shrouds, kafan, and they do all kind of things in that way. So water is now sent all over the world, and still the water is there, and this water has its own taste and its own qualities, and these waters are miraculous waters. Of course Makkah had other sources of water as well. In the time of Harun Rashid",
      "Rashid Zubaira his wife she brought from five in her called Nahar Zubaida and that was another supply of water but now they desalinate the water and so water is plenty in Mecca and there you are some of the important things you have that in the city of now City of Makkah also has other",
      "the northern side about three miles out of the city is cave of Hira where the professor Salaam was and it's also known as Jebel Noor when the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam used to go and they are Jibreel Alayhi Salaim came and gave him the message on the southern side is another cave known as a hard soul our sword",
      "companion abu bakr of the law were they took refuge and hid themselves for three days and then after that left for medina so medina is north of mecca but the prophet sallalla went to south to so that to confuse his enemies because enemies they knew that he was going to go to mecca to medina",
      "But the Prophet went to the south so they did not find out although the sense and people are there almost there very close to the cave of the To the cave, but they could not find him So these are some of them Harlem some of the important places. The graveyard of the people of Mecca is called Jenna to Malia Where hadith Allah is buried other companions of the procession were buried And so it is also a graveyard of two people of mecca",
      "a great city nowadays city is large its population is almost three four million so has grown a lot and it has university colleges other facilities you have that in the city of Mecca and then you have the biggest tallest tower that they have made it called Burj Makkah and you have a big clock there and malls and all",
      "see it's not considered good but it is there all right so that's the way the city of mecca is so when they go they come to the city they find some place for their stay hotels or other places and then after that they come",
      "Ritual for whether you make over or you make a hodge You have to make them off in order to make the loss. We need a harm and a haram has a place outside, Mecca there are places called me hot and From the me thought you put on a hum for men but women is intention women don't have to change their clothes They can have their own modest clothes But they have two men have to wear put on around and with this around they come to Makkah",
      "and then the sale of bake Allahumma back and then they make tawaf so it's tawaff tawafa starts from Heather Aswad that's that's area from Heather as well if you are near you can touch it and kiss it if you're not there then you can be anywhere you can do stand in front of a sword and then you point towards it inshallah Akbar and then move and",
      "counterclockwise so this is how they're as well in case in a silver covering and This is The kiss what they are changing the kiss was you can see that some of the walls are open And you go there, and this is the door of the cup but the door up the car by it's not on the ground level You have to take a ladder so good. The road is little high why they put that way So that common people will not just go inside",
      "go inside so you need a special thing to go there and this was later that was done so he'll have it and then see this is the Rukun Ruknul Hajar this is a corner for the higher as well and this is called look on Shami and then after that you have ruku naira key and then you have Rukuni Amani",
      "you can touch it if you don't ever not near it then you don' t do anything and here is the place where people hug the Kaaba",
      "praying to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that I'm holding the steps of your door and I am asking you begging you to pray to bless me and bless my family it is permissible to do that under other places",
      "can touch part of the cover but you cannot do that only in Muslim you do then now this area is on this idea called Hatim or hedgerah Ismael they don't see that",
      "So when you people go make the valve they go around this You are not supposed to go from inside but inside if you go to you can pray This is really part of Kaaba so it was Kaaba was not When they were building the Arabs and they're willing it. They shortened it. He said there did not have enough funds So they leave that place, but they have put a marking. It's like a crystal shape parking and People kind of stand there. So just call Hatim",
      "is called Hatim so that's what the waifu then after the Tavafeel then then people go drink some some water and then they go and suffer and Marwa",
      "and it further is Marwa between suffer and more way 450 meter distance and you have to go start from Safa go up little on the hill and then you say in a sophomore or at Amish I Dela and then",
      "together it's almost two miles and now they have measured very wide it used to be people used to go walk in the street and shops on both sides but now there is no shops all a part of the harem and it has very nice floor air-conditioned fans and all those things you can see that",
      "for coming in between they have a place for wheels chairs for those who cannot walk they have wheelchairs if you go on top on the third floor you have motor rails you can drive yourself so there are all that it's okay it's permissible to ride uh on something so that is and there are several floors ground floor underground floor second floor third floor",
      "For for Masa Masai the place of sign so sighing is also in remembrance of Hajra Because she's the one who ran between suffer and more were praying to Allah spandrel asking water For her for herself or child and I granted that So that's what people do. And then there is an area called millennia of terrain See that this light green light",
      "light and there's another green light between these two you have to almost run between this soon because this was deeper Valley and she was not able to see the Sun so she was running and that would just do that remembering hajara after you finish the sign if",
      "you can clip your hair or shave your the head up your head and take off your arm and if you are haji and you want to continue with your harm then you don't do that and the high time just like today 8th of the Hajj ah now judge who are there and especially those who come from outside of Mecca they do that they make the",
      "that's the first thing at a time of high eights of the hijab people go to Mina so Mina is about Mina is above four miles between 4 to 6 mile outside of my count the eastern direction east of Mecca I tell it is also very historic place",
      "on the other side of the valley is called Wadi muhassir what the muhasar is the wadi where Abraha's armies came to attack Kaaba and that's why the problem said don't go there if you go pass by what a master passed fast but that's not included in Mina so this is a boundary line and people go and spend first time",
      "Mina is called Mina it is because since the time of Ibrahim alayhi salam later people used to sacrifice animals behatum nadima the bloods are shed there that means the blood of sacrifice and sacrifices are made there so that's why it is a place of sacrifice so that way its name is Mina so Mina has man her the",
      "that is the places where people throw stones not on the 8th but they come back from our father and they do that and Mina also had a big masjid called much it's high and that is",
      "So the Mina is eighth of the hijjah Yom at-terviya They go to to Mina and then from Mina next day That tomorrow the judge will be doing that ninth of the Hajja they go for a minute to Arafa so from Minna to RFI is about 10 miles and Now you have trains Very nice trains",
      "These are automatic trains electric train This is the area of all of her So earlier bridges and always take you there from Mina to Arafat Now you can go by train. You can go buy bus. You go by car you can walk so there is a road called tariq al-mushad",
      "for people who want to walk and this is perhaps the largest that the longest road for walkers longest world in the world or people who won't walk and it's very nice covered to protect people from sunshine and it has chairs and both directions and also cool water then the water is available there so a lot of",
      "I mean 10 miles those who are young shoddy and they can walk the walk and actually before the trains came it was used to be very difficult to go from Mina to RFI sometimes would take five or six hour ten mile for five or 6 hours so people say why to go there you just well let us go and walk",
      "and Arafah that is the valley of Arab it's a huge Valley of course has its boundaries so one cannot go in this valley you have this here called Jabal al-rahma the mountain of mercy the Prophet sallallaahu was stood there and prayed and",
      "So many people a lot of people go there and make do I you don't have to You can do the off from your own camera from your tent, but people go here And they are tense put in because the daytime is hot so they put tents in an alpha and They're not too many buildings It's all tents. So it's a tent city. So people come Morning, you can come from Zohar time",
      "and leave by mother of time and actually if you miss that you can be in in our until the next morning for the time and if somebody passes before that it's hard to look good but its best time is from Zohar until sunset so for judge come there they",
      "Gemma and Kasra, and this person is because of hajj so to raka Zohar in Turka Asa and before this prayer there is a hood war that is given by the Imam in the masjid of Arafat and must have our father's called Nimrah Mustard in Nimro Masjid Ibrahim al-khalil One of the name of their city musted Ibrahim Al Khalil And many people go there in this masjids",
      "must be Namira so they go and pray here you see that big machine and You don't need to I mean, you don't have to go not every hardy goes there but it's still thousands and thousand go there many people Pray in their own tent So when we go with the darsalam, there is a prayer in our own tents and one of us",
      "one of us especially the imam for taking here they asked him to give the hotba and then we have the prayer so what by is given after that there is any karma and then the prayer Zohar an ass like anytime without any loud car no Jeff in that slot and it is not you mom when you are in our father's no Juma although sometimes high jayden jumma but you don't pray do my dear",
      "the hood buffer height at that time so it is to RFI is a value why you just call our offer there's several explanation it's called out of us and people say because they said when last one tell us sent down Adam alayhis salaam and his wife how I listen up Adam came in how I came",
      "Our parents they met there So they had their association the Union after coming from heaven to earth another meaning of our fire is Is that Ibrahim alayhi salam jibreel came and took Ibrahima less alone and showed him the places Hard to what to do in alpha and every time you say, oh Do you know",
      "that's why it's called on another explanation the third explanation is this is the place where people come from all over yet are a phone they know each other they meet each other there's the place of gathering and meeting another thing if they say otherwise from orif an orphan is perfume so it is",
      "where the people will be gathering on the day of resurrection so it is expecting that allah swan that will give them the perfume of paradise so they have beautiful explanations for the place of arafat or they call it arafa and al-fat is the same thing the place the time is called arifa and the places are fat",
      "Come at noontime They have prayer Lord and awesome then they have lunch after learning to take some rest And then they stand up and make dua Actually, it's called whoo-hoo farafa. Who does not mean that you have to stand up if you cannot stand up You can have chair. It's okay Some people have chairs But this is called the hoof that was staying in alpha and he's taking out of either until group time",
      "until group time but you don't put a mother up there even the time of modern came that you don t very much and after the mother live after the sunset without praying mother you leave it's called the fear now leaving so say leave everybody just moving out of Arafa I want to do they go to most Alifah was delivised between Mina",
      "So when you are coming from Mina to Arafah, you pass by Madhava So now the train can take you you go to train station and then go from there. The next stop is Madhavipa At what they'll happen will go down was deliver me Yes, the leaf only a veto They're coming back to spend the night there If the laugh is spending the night so they spent the night in that place and this is the place",
      "This is the place where you have a big Masjid called Al Mashar al-Haram Faisal for of autumn in Arafat in first call Allah in the mushroom home when you return from our path Stop at a place called Mashallah harm so much or haram is the masjid around the muster people stay And they're parking spots where people park their cars Their buses and in between there's area where they sit down",
      "they sit down and there is no tent there is nobody so you everybody is without any covering so you are you experience homelessness nothing like a lot of people poor people they don't have anything I'll just lie down on the ground",
      "Facilities facilities people go and make the toilet and they pray Maghrib in Asia as soon as they arrive in Malaysia together And they collect pebbles The pebble that they are going to throw on the next day. They collect from there I mean you don't have to collect from their but a lot of people collect from them because it's easy to collect From there, it's a lot",
      "nine bubbles or 72 levels 70 people yeah they collect like that because you can do it either two days or three days so that is uh and then it is required to stay the who spent the whole night in mudarifa it is why jip a lot of people ignore that it is valid to stay",
      "women or old people or sick people if somebody is sick somebody's old and weak and women they are allowed to leave after midnight and because they need some somebody who can help them so those who are helping them they can also go but those people were healthy",
      "So the best thing is to spend the whole night you can sleep And get up early and pick the hajju pray, and then you pray for early and then leave after that And you can take a train but four miles from there Take a train from most deliver to Mina so back to Mina We started on the eighth day like today. They started from Mina and off on the tenth day after further",
      "father then there's a hajja you come back to Mina and you go back to your tent from where you started and there are several things that you can do you have to do on this day that is the tenth of the hijab which is our aid but they don't have either but I don't heavy it there is those thing that they're doing so",
      "those who are not making hajj so they come and what they do the first thing is they go to jambara one jamra only today i call gemarasul akba so they go there to that jumrah and there they throw seven pebbles why jama means a place of gathering and there are there is a small wall that is made there",
      "with delphi night yeah you see that everybody is lying there and they open area and then they come to the center of the hijjah and this is now they made a wall it used to be small pillar but now they meditate so it's easy nobody can miss that and you are supposed to go under there is a circle there which hold the carry",
      "seven pebbles it becomes a mountain of pebbles so they collect pebbles chickpea size and they throw there and there are three gemblers the first one the second one third one now sometimes people call you shaitan",
      "as i returned there in the in the parsi language so there is no such thing as shaitan there it's not shaytan its only thing is to do the zikr of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and throw the pebbles so pebbles are zikra falla and we even though come to the eid day what we do",
      "is the Zikr of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala why they do it in the remembrance of Rahim alaihissalam if I him and his Salam when he was taking his son for sacrifice Shaitan appeared to him that's the most famous tradition said that Shaitaan appeared to Him and told him not to do that and he threw stones upon him casted Shaitaun away from",
      "to please Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala turn away the Shaitan that's one thing the other is some mother scholars say this is what a muhassir area close to wadi muhasar and this is the place where Abraha army came to attack the Kaaba and alas wonder I sent ababil the birds and the bird pelted them with stone termine the yard in the",
      "those people who came to dishonor the Kaaba and destroy the cover how they were destroyed and you are making a play that you are going to protect the Kaabah of Allah SWT and you're going to devote yourself to the calm so some scholars say it is a remembrance of the event that mention its or to fill alum track and for father of the field I'll am yet on Kaden we thought Lilo our Salah him fire an ababil now by the way Ababil",
      "that ababil is like a small swallow no ababil means swarm a large number tired our first said tired these birds were like vultures terrible birds their faces were like the beast's faces and they're there their feet were like like the dog's feet so with these are vulturers",
      "They're carrying a stone and they throw upon them and then they ate their bodies after that So that's why I mentioned that of a builder. That made a small world about really means swarms with more So these are the birds that came and they destroy some people said this is remembrance of death and But the most famous one is now this Gemara",
      "large number of people come and that's why they used to be a lot of accidents that is stampede you should take place because small area people are going and coming in the same direction now they have now they",
      "escalators and then you have several levels and The big roads you can they can take thousands and thousands of people and there you stand on the bridge And you see almost like a ocean of people coming to throw their stones so on the 10th 11th and 12th Jamal ad become very busy So people spend the time in Mina",
      "the second thing they do is they go and make sacrifice so there is man hard in Mina the place of sacrifice and a lot of lamps there not a people used to go and still they go under do their own sacrifice by the lamb and make a sacrifice or camel you can buy it and make",
      "on their behalf so the IDB Islamic Development Bank has established places and people pay about 500 real or so for sacrifice and they give them the receipt and they do that what sacrifice you are doing are you doing to sacrifice for a hedge or using the sacrifice for dumb that means you made some mistake and you're doing like a fidya",
      "They make sacrifice in your best. You don't have to do it So people don't help to a lot everybody makes sacrifice Although they pay because required if you are doing hajjat, Amato or hijab Quran then you must make sacrifice Hadji fraud you don't need that so these are some rules of that of sacrifice and they Do that? Gemma not without the gemara This is mostly the high off in Mina as we talk about",
      "and this is the place of with higher sacrifice where nowadays I mean people used to do that I remember in 62 there was no such thing so we used to go and buy the animal and make sacrifice and what we are going through it that so we just leave it there and we were walking over",
      "and all the thing and it used to smell the whole area so now alhamdulillah things are being much more organized so there are the bodies of the animals were taken immediately and people clean them prepare the meat if somebody want to take the meat they can take the meet otherwise this meat is frozen packed and sent to poor countries in Africa and Asian places so I tell you within a short period",
      "hamdulillah the meat is used it's not wasted otherwise in the old days they used to bring a bulldozer and buddy all that thousands and thousands of sheep never buried under the ground so now you're there using that meat so after that sacrifice you can see that people are having their hair",
      "the in their tents they have a lot of barbers they help the people or people can do to each other also you can do that so either your trim the hair or you shave the hair and do that do it so you have Gemara and then after you sacrifice and then you have the hull or faster that means shaving or trimming the hair then we will go",
      "regular clothes took after him so they're almost high G's now huh so then after that they spend either the go the same day to Mecca and make the off and this is called the waffle if father obligatory tough so they go to my card make the love and then come back to me again and you spent the night in Mina and you are supposed",
      "12th day of the Hajj in Mina and in these days you go to Jamarat three Jamarat seven seven seven two twenty one pebbles through first they're only seven and a second day 21 third day 21 that's why you have 49 and then you throw this pebble and in the evening there are very nice programs lectures discussions",
      "So it's kind of a celebration people do that as Prophet said these are yama. Okay, we should this is the days of eating and Enjoying from halal drinks so you do that? So that's people do there so they're beautiful You know buffet that prepared and nice meal is there so you have that I meet with people Then on the 12th, you can leave if you want to",
      "is you can leave it after two days or you can stay so you want to can live on the 12th after awesome prayer you throw the pebbles and go good back to Mecca or you are stay another day 13th and then you go after throwing the pebble in the afternoon then",
      "you do if you are planning to leave and go back to your home on the 13th or 14th then you make another top off and this tomorrow is known to offer Lada which is required for those who make hajj it's not required for",
      "they can go home and they are now hajis if they want to go to Medina they can't go to medina so some people go to madina before something good about you after but as I said hadj is not in Madinah Hajji's in Mecca so this is a short history of those places tour of those place it now there many little bit details the rules",
      "we have not covered that inshallah when you plan to go to hide will do that in Shana Barak allah fico and thank brother shy preparing on this slides mashallah nice nice pictures fashion all done is there any more picture but you want to good so questions and comments",

      "But when the Qur'an came, Allah SWT especially signified and designated this month as the month of fasting. So Ramadan, you know, Arabic months were based on seasons. Most probably the months we have now pure lunar calendar but the Arabs used to have what they call it unisolar calendar",
      "lunar and solar combined. And so it is possible that this time when the Ramadan was chosen, that was a hot month. It was summertime because Ramadan means something hot. So it probably was a hard month and Allah swt chose this month for fasting. And because during this month Allah swat",
      "night of qadr is the night of quads better than one thousand months and knight of father unanimously is the knight in the month of ramadan our prophet said in abu hadith has a night in this month which is better than 1000 months",
      "the one who is did not receive the blessings of the night of father is actually is really a lost person he's a loser help us to take full benefit of the month of ramadan you know ramadan is the month",
      "so that means there are more incentives to do a good thing and every evening an angel calls and says oh the seeker of goodness come forward and all the seekers of evil stop desist uh so there is a goodness that prevails all over especially in the muslim community alhamdulillah",
      "every part of the world we become much more conscious of allah and we should celebrate them with fasting with the ibadah with the recitation of the quran with zikr and tasbih all of these things and then of course",
      "Sheikh Muneeb, welcome to you. Are you able to hear me okay? I'm having a problem hearing myself so I don't know. Sheikh Munib? Yes we can hear you there's a little bit of an echo but",
      "Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. Alhamdulillahi Rabbil alameen, wasallamu ala ashraf wa min didnti wal rahmani wa barakatuh. Nabeelina Muhammad wa a'la la ilaha illallah, saakir.",
      "to be back inside the listed last year when the pandemic was starting with people that you know we didn't have enough information how could we manage it safely uh we would we were required to stay at home and you know many of us that are here right now inside domestic we happen to live very close to the rest so we would see them on a daily basis",
      "And you would feel this deep longing that you want to come back inside the masjid, you wanna be able to perform salah with other Muslims, listen to their recitation of the Quran in the tarawih prayers inside the Masjid. And yet we did not have that opportunity last year so we did what we could but Alhamdulillah it is such a wonderful blessing to be back inside",
      "something you know we're quite used to coming to the business over the years again and again but when we lost that opportunity for one year now you value it, you treasure it so much more. So the truth of that is like we are very excited to be back inside the listed and really like you know I'm here we uh we're reminded that perhaps this may be the last",
      "maybe the last month of Ramadan that we get to witness and enjoy its blessings. And this year, the previous year just really emphasized that level because there are so many brothers and sisters in our community. There were so many of us in our communities that you know Allah SWT has became and they're no longer with us.",
      "and grant sabr to their families and loved ones. But we have this opportunity now, at home they love it up here so it is really a time for us to reflect that we want to strive to make the most of this month We want to get the best out of this one. We don't just want to settle for the minimum or just settle for being average. We wanna do the best that we can to achieve the most that we",
      "that Allah is giving us a chance again to witness. Thank you Dr Siddiqui, you of course rightly said Ramadan is literally around the corner Muslims the world over wait ardently for this month what should we be doing now to prepare for this Month? Any major adjustments we need to make to our daily routine or do we carry on business as usual put us in",
      "appropriate mindset set the stage for us if you will for the next 30 days dr siddiqui please sir dr siddiq i think you're muted",
      "Okay. I said that everything starts with the intention, niya. Niya is very important. The first thing is to make the intention. You start thinking about it. That is that I am inshallah going to fast in this month and I'm going to take full benefit of this time. And I ask Allah SWT to help me because my intention is yes correct but I cannot do that without",
      "cannot do that without Allah's help, without Allah. I am planning inshaAllah to fast during this month and taking full advantage of this month. I will try to improve myself. I'll try to make self a better person. So you make this intention and preparation for that physical preparation that you should do that. That is started planning in your home with your family",
      "home with your family that we are going to fast during the month of Ramadan and we are doing this, we are do that. Make your home prepared for that. Bring whatever is needed you should bring it in the home so that everybody, the whole family become oriented towards the month",
      "and drinking, fasting is that zikr of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, tasbihat, reading of the Quran, doing charity, action, helping. It is a comprehensive program to change the individual, the family, and the community. It's a comprehensive",
      "That is the kind of a program that you have an annual refresher course, that we are going to go through. Physically my eating habits are going change, my food intake is going to change and I prepare myself for that. If somebody has to consult because of some medical issues or has to counsel the doctor should consult the doctor. So prepare yourself for that especially in this pandemic situation",
      "situation important you should see what you think you have to do, what you will not do how are you going to protect yourself so you be aware of that and the second thing is that that is turning to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala preparing your family and planning about your reading of the Quran doing the zikr of Allah performing the prayers on time",
      "tarabih prayer observe the tarabish prayer whether you do it in the masjid or you do at home but do it tarawih prayers are very important during the mantapuram don't neglect that some people pray 8 rakahs and we play 20 rakah whatever rakah you pray but do that with proper intention that inshallah allah swanthali bless me and listen to the quran in the mosque insha'Allah our masjids will have full reading of the qur'an",
      "of the quran you know what will have the 20 but if you cannot do it do it at your home read the qur'an yourself because a lot of people they uh they neglect that even in the month of ramadan they don't read the Quran try to finish the qura yourself in your own personal reading you should do that so these are the preparation these are",
      "Pray to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, make dua. Allah help us reach the month of Ramadan and make it easy for us to fast during this month and make dua in prayers during this months. Thank you. Sheikh Munir what advice would you offer? And speak especially to our youth now",
      "So. What advice would you offer before Ramadan and speak to our youth, some common do's and don'ts for Ramadan?",
      "So in terms of do's, obviously as our Shri. Imam Abbas mentioned there is the acts of worship that we want to do, there is fasting obviously, but fasting is not only about staying on food and drink it's also about protecting ourselves from all types of sins so protecting ourselves",
      "from the sins of the ears, from listening to things that we should not be listening to that are not allowed in our Sharia. From sins of tongue, gossip, backbiting, cursing, lying all types of you know vain talk, sins of uh of the heart, sins off you know wasting your time so we should as part of our fasting you know abstaining from food and drink is",
      "as in which the Quran was revealed. And this act of fasting, if you look at it is a way of controlling our nafs, controlling our desires for food and drink that often lead us to other sins sometimes. Controlling our nafas and suppressing that and allowing ourselves to develop spiritually",
      "accelerated pace. So Allah has given us this opportunity to embrace the Quran, to listen to the Quran and to recite the Quran so we should make a goal that we want to finish the Quran at least once throughout the whole month and it may sound daunting initially but you know the Quran is been divided into parts so that we can cover an entire month",
      "each you can divide it through the course of the day so there's 20 pages so you know and if you want to read 20 pages or you want",
      "This is something that's a great sunnah and a great practice of the Ummah, where we come at night and listen to the recitation of the Quran. We stand before Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala and we listen to that complete recitation. And Alhamdulillah in our rastis we're having that opportunity again together and to listen to",
      "to take part in as much as we can. Another thing that I want to emphasize a lot is also the act of spending or charity in the path of Allah, giving in the paths of Allah. The Prophet was described as very generous, you know, the Prophet was always very, very generous.",
      "He was even more generous in the month of Ramadan when he would meet with Jaddi and recite the Quran to him. They would read the Quran, and he will be as generous as the falling wind. And as you know our rewards are multiplied. So in this month we should set a habit that I want to consistently and continuously give charity.",
      "And let us try to as much as we can, whatever Allah has given us of you.",
      "that thought of like holding back is strong but as you give more, as you get more and experience the benefits of giving. As the Prophet has promised us that when you give Allah SWT will give you more than that. Your wealth does not increase in charity. When a person goes through that experiences the rewards and benefits in this life then it becomes easier and easier so build up on them after",
      "act of giving to the various causes that are out there. And another aspect is setting aside some time for talking to Allah. You know, when one gives us this opportunity, we wake up early in the morning for subhut and we're having our meal before we eat the fast, but how long do you need to get up? Early! So wake up a few minutes before that. Pray two or three hours of religion if not more.",
      "if not more and a few minutes of talking to allah",
      "And since you're already getting up, it's much easier than doing any other time of the year. So let us make sure that we take advantage of these blessed moments. And amongst adults, we want to make sure we are not wasting our time. We don't want to lose this precious moment that Allah is giving us this opportunity again. Let us make",
      "you know, we might want to take a second look at them and say that for the love of Allah I'm going to turn off my social media accounts or I'm gonna limit my participation in that. But normally we're just swiping mindlessly, swiping, swiping, swipping and it does affect us spiritually, mentally, affects us in different ways. This is not the time for these distractions. It's not the country displaying mindlessly",
      "swiping through endless pages of our social media feeds. This month is a lot more serious than that. So let us, you know, try to make the intention that this month I'm going to turn off my Facebook account. I'm gonna turn off whatever other social media I'm on or I'm goint to very, very secretly restrict it to what's absolutely necessary if someone has a very big necessity to use that. Um so these are some of the things another thing that along those lines",
      "and let us focus, and use our enemies strategically for developing ourselves, for growing spiritually in this very, very blessed month. Thank you. Thank You Dr. Siddiqui and Sheikh Muneeb for these words of inspiration. May Allah give us the tawfiq to follow. Amen. Amen! Dr.Siddiqi thank you. May we join you for a closing du'asah?",
      "and protect us and keep us on the right path",
      "and with the right intention, inshallah, and avoid all the sins and all the mistakes. Oh Allah, help us to observe the night prayers during the month of Ramadan, the tarawih prayer. Help us to recite the Quran as it should be recited. Help up to understand the meaning of the Quran. Oh, Allah, Help us remove from us all the sin and all of the mistakes and all shortcomings that we have in our life. Purify us and clean us and help us grow",
      "grow and have mercy upon us and forgive our mistakes to allah and emancipate us from the hellfire",
      "today Vicky we wish you stay hold back"

      "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله",
      "May Allah bless all of us. Ramadan Mubarak. May Allah accept our siyam, our qiyam, all our ibadat. This is a month of fasting. This",
      "This is the month of charity, month of sadaqat and khairat. So what we are going to talk about is zakat which is a special charity, restricted charity but sada'ah is a general term and believers are required or urged to be the people of sado'a",
      "accept the tawbah and accept the sadaqat ألم يعلموا أن الله هو يقبل التوبة عن عباده ويأخذ الصداقات وأن الله هو الطباب الرحيم إن تبدو الصدقات فنعما هي وإن تخفوها وتؤتوها الفقراء فهو خير لكم ويكفر عنكم من سيئاتكم والله بما تعملون خبير",
      "That is, Allah SWT accepts the tawbah and Allah SWt takes the sadaqat. Sadaqah that Allah SWC takes it and accepts and blesses people who give the sadeqa. And sadeka can be given openly, can be giving secretly, privately whatever way you give sadekha. Sadeqah from the word Sidq and sadaquh So sadekhah shows a person's truthfulness, sincerity",
      "sincerity. And also when you give to somebody, you care for that person. So your sadaqah, your love and care for the person. It's not charity I'm giving you charity. I am giving you because you are human being and we all have to care for each other. So sadaquah is a general charity and we are required to give. And it could be money or something else.",
      "Even meeting somebody with a smiling face is sadaqah. It's a good thing. So, sadaquah every day you should do that. Sahaba said, Ya Rasulullah, who has so much money to give sadaaqua every day? There are many doors for good things. So you speak nicely, you help somebody who is walking and somebody wants to ride, you give rides, you",
      "you can do that and then he said if you give charity, if you money in sadaqah it will increase your money. It will bring the more blessings of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala so money does not decrease because of charity but then there is a special charity which is obligatory",
      "So Zakat is a special charity. And it is the pillar of Islam, I mean arcane Islam. Just like Shahada, Salat, Siyam that we are doing now, Hajj. In a similar way, Zakat means Farida. But this Farida is not on everyone, only those who have money and the money has reached. Saab as you will talk about that.",
      "It is a fareeda, those who have money they are supposed to use a card. And Abdullah ibn Umar said that Rasulullah said Islam is established on five things",
      "and these are arkan. Rukun is that which is essential, something will not stand, something does not exist unless it is done that way so that's why it's one of the arkan, one of rukun of Islam. So those who deny sakaat as obligatory, as a pillar of Islam they're not Muslims",
      "Muslims out of Islam and those who say yes it is but they don't pay negligent they are sinners committing sin and may incur the punishment of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala in this life and other life so it's very serious that people pay attention to Zakat as they pay attention",
      "Salat as they pay attention to Siyam. It is a beautiful word, Zaka, Yazku something you become sweet nice pure so the Zakat brings purity sweetness happiness in the society and people pay Zakah they care for",
      "یہ صداقہ ہے اور اس میں بھی مذکرانی کا سوال ہے قرآن نے کبھی اگلے وقت صداقة کی یا دنیا کے لئے جواب سے تعلقات کرتا ہے",
      "take sadaqa from their money and you will be purifying them. They will receive purity, purity for the money, purity of the person. It purifies the heart from selfishness, greed, materialism. And also it purifies",
      "Ia menambahkan keuntungan. Kerana berkat Allah SWT dan ia membantu orang miskin dan yang memerlukan. Jadi, semua tiga perkara ini ada di dalamnya. Dan dalam syariah, itu adalah jumlah tertentu yang harus diberikan dari kaya khas dan kepada rakyat tertentunya.",
      "حس مقدرة في مال معين يصرف للطائفة المخصوصة",
      "وقد تذكر في القرآن الكثير من الأحيان ، وأكثر مرة ستجدون ذلك في القورة. يوجد عدة أحيات ، فإن الزكاة تذكار بالصلاة. كما تلقى بأعطاء الزکاة. لذا، الصلاة والزكاية ، جميعهم يتم إخوانها.",
      "Both of them are mentioned together. And those who do not give Zakat, even their Salat is not accepted. May Allah save us from that. Because the whole totality of Sharia, totality Islam and Islam has to be implemented in every aspect of life otherwise the results will be just what we have today in society.",
      "So it is important that people pay attention to all aspects. The Prophet used to emphasize that and also used to mention that there is a great sin in not giving zakat, and the punishment will come here in this life as well as in the life to come.",
      "will be put together and heated in the fire of hell. And by that people will be branded on their backs, on their sides, on there forehead. Taste what you have collected yourself. So there are details of that",
      "and Dr. Usman Umarji has, alhamdulillah, a very nice presentation. We have done this seminar together for two years. So I will let him make the presentation inshallah. And it is very clear, very good presentation.",
      "If Asr is at 5 o'clock, so we'll finish by Asr and then we'll go for prayer. Take a short break for prayer and then you have questions and answers. Okay? Inshallah, we'll have that. Dr. Usman Umarji I have unfortunately my hearing problem has worsened with age. Thank Allah SWT for his blessing.",
      "I enjoyed it but still so we always pray given time for everything so he will sometime questions come out I don't understand what is babe somebody's saying so inshallah you will explain that okay",
      "As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. I seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed. In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Praise be to God and peace be upon His Messenger and his family and companions.",
      "the spiritual aspects of zakah and then we will continue in the second half after asr, the technical aspects and then the questions inshallah. I want to begin by just speaking very broadly about situating why zakah is important to speak about because i know alhamdulillah you guys are here but if you have a welcome ramadan seminar you get a lot of people who show up you have",
      "you'll have a lot of people who come. But certain subjects, for whatever reason, despite the fact they are pillars of Islam like zakah, for some reason the Muslim community is still very far from understanding and so I want to just again thank and acknowledge those of you who made the time today to learn about a topic that's rarely spoken about and as Dr. Muzamil mentioned it's something which is so serious it can take someone out of Islam if they don't practice it. Actually one of the most scary and profound kind of manifestations",
      "when the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, he died. And Abu Bakr as-Siddiq became the Khalifa. There was a number of tribes around in the Arabian Peninsula who said that we're no longer going to give zakah because we used to give zakah only to the Prophet, Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. And so when the Sahaba heard about this they had to get together and consult one another what should we do? And many of the companions were like you know what Islam is in a state of chaos right now. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon his soul just passed away.",
      "just passed away. We don't want tribes to revolt. Let's take it easy. Let us not really rock the boat too much.\" And Abu Bakr as-Siddiq was very emphatic in saying that if anybody differentiates between salah and zakah, right? Then we're going to fight them because even if they withhold the reins of a camel in zakah then we would fight them till the end. These are called Harub al-Riddah. They were wars of apostasy where Abu Bakri as- Siddiq and his Sahaba fought these tribes",
      "to force them to pay zakah. So it is something which was taken by force actually, by the Islamic state. The other thing to speak about again is that each pillar of Islam has its own element to it. So shahada is just with the tongue. You say la ilaha illallah Muhammad Rasulullah, just this statement of the tongue you become a Muslim. When it comes to salah, at the very basic level, it's an act of the body. You have to stand up, you have to raise your hands, you",
      "It requires money and it requires your body. But zakah is the only pillar of Islam, it's purely financial. As if Allah SWT is telling us that your faith is not complete if you don't put your money where your mouth is. So if you're going to say la ilaha illallah Muhammadur Rasulullah then there's going to be a cost you're gonna incur to this. A proof that you really believe this which is why the Prophet Muhammad SAW said as-sadaqatu burhan He said charity is proof.",
      "Allah and His Messenger. So you can't say, you know what I believe in Allah's Messenger but don't touch my money. That undercuts the most fundamental belief which is that our wealth actually is not our wealth, our wealth is the wealth of Allah Azza wa Jal and we are simply trustees. Believe in Allah and his messenger and spend from that which we have made you trustees of. Allah has simply told us here is money, our job to say Ya Allah how do",
      "this percent for my son and my daughter when they die, this percent from my wife. I hear and I obey with inheritance laws, and I hear an I obey when it comes to what wealth I distribute to the poor in certain manifestations.\" So inshallah with that we will attempt to quickly kind of invoke and come to a spirit together as to why this matters so much. And the reason I do this is if we start talking about the fiqh of zakah, if you started right now and said right away,",
      "and out. They're like, well what's the way I can minimize my liabilities essentially right? It's like taxes right? And you go to TurboTax or you go your accountant and say, I want every loophole possible to minimize what I give right to the government right? We don't wanna do it with Zaka. Right we don't want to have that attitude of how can I eliminate all my liabilites and give the very minimum. And I'll give you example right there's people who say, to this day we said",
      "I'm in debt. He said, MashaAllah brother you have like a three million dollar house but it's a debt. Those who are in debt don't pay zakah. I said this is not how it works. So we'll learn about all that today. So you have people who are millionaires actually right? Who don't want to pay often there's zakah so as Dr. Zammal mentioned zakah is a beautiful word linguistically and all the ibadat in Islam it's important we come back to the linguistics of them because their secrets within that and so whether it be salah or whether it would be siyam right? Whether it be any of these arcana of Islam",
      "the linguistic meaning gives us some inspiration as to why it matters so much. So Zakah has all these meanings in the Quran, it implies growth, increase, purification, cleansing and as the ayah we mentioned Allah says that when your wealth is taken that it is a means of purification and an increase for you and we have to have Yaqeen in that.",
      "my soul is getting better, and my wealth is actually increasing. My sustenance is going to increase. And as the sharia definition of zakah, what we differentiate here between again sadaqa which is general charity. I can give sadaquah to any cause I want. I could give it to Muslims. I'd give it non-muslims. I would give it you know the masjid. I'll give it a school. I will give it build a road. I'm gonna do whatever cause I like. Unbounded charity but zakah is determined share of wealth prescribed by Allah",
      "to be distributed amongst deserving categories, which means that there is three things we speak about. What is it that I am liable to pay on? What are the zakatable assets? What do the conditions of that wealth has to meet and then who gets that well and in which way so we'll each other unpack all of that. And before we get into all that, it's worth just stopping and saying there are objectives to everything we do in Islam. Some of those are known to us some of them are not known to",
      "especially when it comes to some of the major ones. Allah tells us in the Quran specifically, when it come to salah He says that, That part of salah one of the maqasid and hikm and ilal, the reasons and wisdom behind it for salah is that its going to prohibit us from doing things that are wrong. And its gonna bring us closer to Allah. Fasting again",
      "Fasting is a means to getting piety, God consciousness and protecting ourselves from the wrath of Allah Azza wa Jal. Zaka as well has its objectives and amongst those objectives they are very macro not just micro yes it purifies your soul of stinginess Yes it purify's your wealth but actually has a greater manifestation in society It is the financial pillar of Islam right so what does it do? It is first and foremost a welfare system of Islam",
      "that a society that generates wealth also has to have a system of redistributing that wealth. And zakah is the primary mechanism of redistribution. Number two, it is part of the infrastructure of an Islamic economy. During the pandemic, how many of you got stimulus checks? Anybody? Why did the government give you a stimulus check? Is it because they like you and they're just like, you know, we got extra money, here's money for you? What was the logic of the government?",
      "To spend. They're worried that if people are scared, that there's economic uncertainty, they're going to hold their money back. And if you hold your money back and you don't put it into the economy, it actually makes the economy go down faster. That's what facilitates recessions. So part of it is that you're redistributing money to those who don't have it because those who",
      "bank. No, they need it for their food, they needed for the rent, and in it for there life necessities so that money but the wealth the wealthy would just store and do nothing with would now get into the hands of those who are needy who will then put it back into the economy that actually benefits the wealthy as well so everybody benefits in the economic system right when we distribute zakat and that stabilizes the society it alleviates poverty and one of the most important things it creates that harmony between",
      "We live in a world today that the poor hate the rich everywhere. In most societies, the poor have disdain for the rich and actually the rich have disdayn for the poor. It's the culture of America especially this belief of a meritocracy that everything I've done it's an even playing field no idea here of Allah being in charge that Allah distributes as He likes. This is a fundamental point when Allah says in the Quran",
      "Indeed, and that are signs for the believers. As you get older, you see these things in real life. When you're young, you think it's I work hard, I become rich. I don't work hard? I don' And then you go through life when you see things. Remember I worked at a corporation, a large engineering company, Fortune 500 Company",
      "And there was people who did not have bachelor's degrees, people who hardly had like a high school diploma. They were in the right place at the right time. They got shares. They became millionaires and have coastal houses in Laguna today. High school degrees, right? Or you worked at Microsoft when it first started and you were a janitor or you were, you know, in some other HR position that required really very little expertise. But you got shares and your shares made you a millionaire.",
      "made you a millionaire. Is this because of your hard work? This is the qadr of Allah, that he intends for some people to be rich and he intents for some to have restricted means even if they work hard. We accept the qa'dur of Allah. You see people with PhDs living in Egypt, you drive around half of the taxi drivers, they have advanced degrees. Be driving literally! And the guy's like oh yeah I have a PhD in economics, I have",
      "This is the Qadr of Allah. To live in a certain time, in a place, in circumstance and so that's really important I come back to this idea because it creates that harmony when you realize my wealth is not because of my hard work alone It's because of Allah Azza wa Jal determining this for me He knew that this wealth is good for me and maybe saving my iman And he knew if Allah had given wealth to someone else maybe that's not good for their faith We don't know",
      "If you give everybody an abundance of wealth, there'd be corruption in the world. Some people power corrupts and wealth corrupts. And for some people poverty corrupts, and that's why the Prophet said that someone will ask Allah Azza wa Jal for wealth and Allah will turn them away from wealth towards poverty because it is better for them. And someone will asked Allah for poverty but Allah will turned them towards wealth because that is better each with a hikmah of Allah. So now as society where a rich person, this is not because of my hard work alone",
      "I'm going to give it to the poor people. How does the poor respond to that? Rather than cursing, the rich person will say, Alhamdulillah, may Allah increase you. May Allah increase in wealth because you do good with it. And the person who has the wealth now also looks at the poor right with a different heart and this is why this harmony of sadaqah right even friendship right is supposed to develop right between all classes of society because we distribute and share these things one another out of our love",
      "from one another out of our obligation to Allah Azza wa Jal. So in a society that practices zakah, you see these manifestations come about and so you see that zakah then addresses poverty. You see it creates economic growth. You say it reduces the crime rate. A society where people don't have to resort to crime is a society with lower crime rates. People used to say all the time, they said, you know, the Muslim countries are so corrupt. Oh people lie and cheat",
      "They bribe and they this and that. And they sit from the comfort of their homes in America or the West, and then you saw again that even the Americans or Europeans, you put them in a financial crisis, everyone starts cheating. When the going gets tough, right? That's when the nafs is inclined towards doing things that are immoral. Allah said in the Quran, الشيطان يعيدكم الفقرة ويأمركم بالفحشة Right? Shaytan, the key thing he does is promise people poverty.",
      "promises you of poverty, then he commands you to immorality. Because once you fear you're going to be poor now you begin to justify the haram. Well everyone else cheats, everyone else lies, everyone deceives and so actually when you give zakah and we redistribute that wealth it lowers the incentive of somebody to resort to the immoral and that could be either moral bankruptcy or even crime in this regard. Another big aspect of zakah I want",
      "Islam is holistic in its economic guidance. The system of economics, right? Zakat is a part of it. How? Omar bin Al-Khattab, he said the statement that many attributed back to the Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam where he said, He said invest the wealth of orphans. So even if you have an orphan that you're responsible over don't just let their wealth sit around because",
      "Because if it sits around, then the zakah will consume it. So in other words there is an incentive to invest your money in Islam as well. If you have a checking account and there are people like this who are out there they're very risk-averse I know some of them they come and say Sheikh I'm very scared I don't want to put my money in the stock market for this reason or that reason I just have it in checking account This is a very bad idea. Islam discourages this behavior actually Why? because when you invest your",
      "that creates growth as well. It creates jobs, right? It creates growth, right and it creates you know economic prosperity and one of the incentives is if you had a hundred thousand dollars of money and You said you know what I don't want to invest in after one year. You have to pay zakat on it That's twenty five hundred dollars now after year one you have ninety seven thousand right five hundred And then he said okay I don' t wanna invest it again year two and your three and four After six years alone you would have lost almost over fourteen thousand dollars",
      "You have a 14% loss on your income if you did not invest it. So in many cases, right? Zakat is like a negative interest rate financially speaking economically speaking, right its room It's two and a half percent right that money that's being taken away now Of course there's a spiritual side we haven't gotten into just purely economic Omri the club is commenting They don't let your money sit around invest it Now for those of you who invest money would you pick an investment that gave you two and 1-1-2 return",
      "return? No. Most of you wouldn't, right? What's a good return? 4.5? Okay. Anybody else? I know you guys invest. What's all you want above inflation? You just wanna break even? Yeah typically you'd say in this society",
      "typically like 7% to 8%, so 5% to 7%, 8%. That's normal. People would say that's a safe investment. They're comfortable with that. They would say if I have a 2% investment, they would take their money out and put it somewhere else. Now, that's important because we have this mechanism that we put our money into investments. We're going to get back, inshallah, 7%, eight, 9%. And as that keeps growing up, Allah is not saying give all your profits. Actually, a very small portion of that, two and a half percent just cash will get into the other aspect",
      "We'll get into the other aspects, but the beautiful thing is that your wealth will not decline over time if it's being invested even as you're paying zakat and That is a motivation for us to invest our money in good in right places And it's gonna might go up and I might go down this nature of life But typically investments go up over time. As long as you making wise choices. I Wanted to share this graph because I want to put into perspective what happens in the system that we don't have zikr This is just showing from the late 80s to",
      "to 2016, how does wealth operate in a society where actually you don't have a vehicle like Zakat redistribute and you actually have the opposite vehicle. You have interest to increase your wealth. So in America back in 1989 just look at the graph real fast, you see that the bottom 90% of Americans owned about 1 3rd of the wealth of the country. The bottom 90 percent owned about 33% of the",
      "Look at the last few decades, how they've declined. Now they own less than a quarter of the wealth in America. Imagine it. 90% of Americans own less that 25% of the world. Now you go to the top 9%. They owned about 37%, and now they own little bit more. They have gone up a little percent here and there. But you see the top 1% have gone over the decades from 30% to getting closer to 37-38%. What is all this saying?",
      "saying. This is saying that in this society, right? The rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer. And this again is why we have that hatred in society because of poor they see that and they see there's no way for mobility when the system is before us at a collective level. And again just to kind of give you more, if you were to look at the distribution of wealth in America, the top 0.1% their average net worth",
      "is about 1.5 billion dollars okay? 1. 5 billion billion right so those of you are good at math 0.1% give me a fraction out of every how many people do we is one is point one percent one in how many is it one hundred is the one in ten one thousand right so one and",
      "worth of 1.5 billion dollars okay just want you to take that right what is there's the car annually on one point five billion dollars math isn't at this time it's wrong with long because they're tired so 37 and a half million dollars a year right now I just want me to realize how many so one in a thousand how many people do we have an America in that 0.1 percent",
      "extrapolate this but the point i'm making here is that the amount of zakat would actually just be generated even in this broken corrupt economic system if the top 0.1 percent we're giving or the top one percent would be astronomical right we're talking about in the hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars of zaka being generated right and i say all that oh here's my chart i can show it to you right so the top point one percent they have about 1.5 billion dollars of wealth",
      "of wealth average, and you can keep going up that list. So the point here I'm making is that if you were to just envision and just imagine that the Sharia is being applied, you will see how much money would be redistributed from those who are wealthy to those who not. So let's move to that. I want us to actually put some real numbers behind this. The economic impact of Zakat has been studied by Muslim economists over the decades. We had one of the most famous ones used",
      "Dr. Mulder Qaf, a local ISOC member who did some of these studies and many of these Muslim economists what they found was that if a country, they looked at many Muslim nations and they said if that Muslim country could transfer about 4% of their GDP from the rich to the poor then there would be practically no more poor people in that country so one example they had was Pakistan",
      "then they would have no more poor people in Pakistan, right? Then they said, okay, how much money should Zakat generate? And he said, well, according to different countries we estimate between 3 and 7.5% of the GDP would go to the poor if Zakat was implemented which means that worst case scenario you'd eradicate about 75% of poverty best-case scenario you almost have double the need You'd have no poor people and a lot of surplus, right So which means we should have no Muslims in the world",
      "in the world, right? Theoretically. If we have zakah being practiced, we would have very few poor people in the Muslim countries. And so they did some studies and say well how much? Remember, we need about 3 to 7.5%. That's what is needed of zakah in order to meet that threshold. And you found in these various studies that in most Muslim countries you don't even get a percent. You have 0.02% in Egypt or 0.2% in Jordan",
      "in Jordan or Kuwait. So you have less than half a percent, right? In most of these countries which means that the Muslim world for whatever reason is not properly collecting and distributing its Zakah. And before we look and say bad Muslim world let's look at our own society. And are the American Muslims properly paying their Zakah, right. Again that's why we're here to make sure that we are fulfilling our end of the bargain because Allah will ask us not if we alleviated poverty of the Muslim World globally but even our own local Muslims",
      "own local Muslims, right? In Garden Grove, in Orange County, in Southern California. Are we able to at least put a dent in the poverty of our own brothers and sisters? And we can go to history to actually say there's precedent for this, right. A couple of famous scenarios that are mentioned was during the Khilafah of Omar bin al-Khattab when Mu'adh ibn Jabal was the governor of Yemen, that one year he sent back after collecting all the zakat, he sent",
      "was unhappy because al-Mu'adh was like, I don't want you to collect taxes and send me all those taxes. Give it to the poor. And then the next year he had half sent back in the third year. He sent all of that. In other words Mu'adh sent a letter saying that I would give this zakat the first year and two thirds of the zakah fulfilled the needs of the poor and in the second year half the zakat fulfill the needs Of the poor, and then by that third year is there was no more zakat distribute So all the money came back to Medina to be distributed in other ways right?",
      "a short period of time, a few decades. The land of Yemen. The Prophet is the one who sent Mu'adh ibn Jabal when he was a young man to Yemen. He told Mu'ad that perhaps I'll never see you again and he never did. The prophet passed away before Mu'add was ever able to come back but Mu'Add was able to eliminate the poverty in his land. About 100 years later when Omar ibn Abdul Aziz was the Khalifa, the great grandson of Omar ibb al-Khattab similarly the governor of Egypt wrote to him saying",
      "had actually exhausted, right? They used the zakah and there was no more poor people. So then Omar advised them to actually get like people to run up and down the street just yelling in the neighborhoods say is there anyone who has a debt so we can pay off their debt? Are there any slaves that could be purchased so we free you or is there anybody who wants to get married so we pay for you to get marry? And after all of that it was build kind of stations on the highways so people could rest and take breaks. The point again here in Egypt,",
      "eliminating the poverty of that society. So, in conclusion of this first section again I just want us to review that zakah at an individual level has benefits right? It purifies the wealth of a person increases their wealth it blesses their wealth. It prevents it from loss and destruction. This is really important one sometimes people take a very kind of materialistic view of their money. They say you know I have $1,000 in my hand today if the Imam says who was going to give",
      "donation well if I give up $100 I lose it hundred dollars so they're gonna walk out with nine hundred dollars right and they don't realize that there's actually your risk has been written as you're driving home or anything else is happening right your stocks might be going down right something at home might break the you know the toilet breaks didn't call a plumber and he would have lost $100 anyway either you can have their hundred hours go in charity",
      "you get nothing out of it at the end of the day, right? So Allah protects our wealth from loss and destruction when we give it. For the individual, of course as well, it's a means of forgiveness. It raises them in rank, increases them in their good deeds. It increases them risk. This is really important so it's not just you give money and Allah gives you back money but you want health, right, you want peace of mind, you",
      "You want to all these different you know non monetary aspects of risk are also things that are growing when one gives zakah That perhaps it's through our charity the Allahs blessing our children or keeping our health intact right? Or all these other benefits that we wouldn't be able to identify and then of course for society It helps those who aren't perpetual states of need orphans Elderly, right women right they're retired the disabled. It creates jobs eliminates debt in society",
      "It protects against the society collectively it creates harmony creates economic growth and I'll conclude on this section with some ayat where Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala talks about for the Muslims to reframe how we think about growth Because it's fascinating in the Quran There's actually many words that have the meaning of growth or increase and the most common ones that people know are Actually riba and zakah find it fascinating So the word ribba that we all know today to mean kind of",
      "mean kind of economic interest that's haram actually has a very similar linguistic meaning as zakat. They both mean to grow or they both mean increase and so actually it's true when one puts their money right in an interest-bearing account, they're doing it because they want to increase I want this account that's gonna give me 2% back right or 3 percent back right whatever the nominal interest rate is you're hoping that causes your money to grow and then someone thinks",
      "So it seems counterintuitive. Ribah seems to be growth, and zakat actually seems to loss. Right? That's what it seems like. But Allah directly puts this together in the Qur'an to really kind of shake us, to get us out of this material way of seeing the world. A metaphysical understanding of this when He says, وَمَا آتَيْتُمْ مِنْ رِّبَاءٍ لِيَرْبُوَ فِي أَمْوَالِ النَّاسِ فَلَا يَرَبُوا عِندَ اللَّهِ What you see is not the reality.",
      "in riba, in interest-based transactions to grow your wealth with people than to know that it does not grow with Allah. I find the word choice fascinating. One of the common words we use with interest today is we use the word compound interest. What is compound interest? Anyone know? Yeah, so whatever money you put in",
      "whatever money you put in, it's not just the capital that's growing but it's the additional money you've put in. That keeps growing, right? So it's increasing manifest times. Allah uses that same terminology but flips it. He says no, no, No. In interest there is no real growth. There is no barakah, right, there is true increase. But that which you give in zakat desiring the countenance and pleasure of Allah, It is those who will have the compound growth. So now you have to believe. Who do you believe? Do you believe Adam Smith",
      "Adam Smith and do you believe the Federal Reserve or Do you believe Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala and the messengers of all what he was saying? I mean these are serious. I don't say this rhetorically I really really mean it for all of us to stop and say when I'm making my choices with how to spend my money Invest my money Where is my a keen where is my conviction lion post that wealth does not decrease with Sadaqah? La young post Madeline be so the patent for the subdued. Oh, do you really and do I believe it",
      "And do I believe it? That wealth does not decrease with charity. And if you really, really, REALLY believe it then you can see why the Sahaba would have no problem when the Prophet is saying who could give wealth and then the Sahabi comes and says here's a third of my wealth and Umar ibn Khattab comes and say here's half of my well and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq comes and said here's all of my wealth and he says what did you leave for your family? He said I left Allah and His Messenger right? Now the prophet did not ask us to do this",
      "In fact, he told us, don't give more than a third of your wealth. Because there's a fitna to people's nafs if this happens. But the Sahaba had no problem with that. Many of them. Because they had conviction that when I give in charity, that this money is going to grow and it's going to be safe and Allah will take care of my family. So redefine growth and make sure because I know we're here to speak about zakah but I want you to think globally about how you spend your wealth and where you put your investments.",
      "Because all this is one big package of barakah at the end of the day. And I'll conclude on that point, is that barakah is another Arabic word that we're here to understand it, that implies growth and increase. And this is what we want in life. Barakah really what... For non-Muslims, it's a foreign idea. A dollar is a dollar. There's no difference between the dollar that's made in this way and the dollar",
      "has received the tawfiq of Allah Azza wa Jal, and therefore if Allah has given this, he said I accept this money. Then what is he going to do with that? That money's going to be productive, it's gonna be efficient, it' s gonna be nourishing, it will be valuable. And I really mean this when the Prophet Isa says things like the food of one is enough for two, the food is enough four, the four is enough eight. There's something real to this. Sometimes you might go somewhere and buy a meal",
      "and you're still hungry. Happened to you before? Yeah, like man I need a second burger right or you buy food for a group of people and you say man that actually didn't suffice it doesn't suffices if Allah does not bless it if that wealth is not halal right if that well has not been used properly then Allah will restrict the barakah of the meal you bought and someone else he buys much less than you",
      "with all the fries and asides and you're still hungry, and someone buys just a side. And they eat the side and they're full. This is barakah. And we believe in this deep in our soul. Really it's a serious concept. And so I just want us to leave this session by realizing that the value of anything we possess, it's not fixed and intrinsic to that commodity. Rather, the value",
      "that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has given it. This is, we have to believe this. It could be in my house, it could be on my car. You see some people they buy a car and then they're like man I bought this car, it's broke down, this is not working, that is not work. 2024 model stop working in a few months. You someone else they have a 1990 2000 25 year old car 250 thousand miles and the tires keep rolling and engine keeps rolling and what is it?",
      "It's probably Japanese, but beyond that, right? There is some barakah in it, right, that Allah is protecting someone. So you know what not going to give them a flat tire, not gonna give them up, you know transmission needs to be changed, right and so We end this before we go technical as we get ready for Asr Holistically realizing that our wealth has to be halal The means by which we acquire it have to be Halal We have to spend it in a way to protect it from destruction",
      "that Allah increases it in goodness, ultimately not just for our individual benefit but for the benefit of the entire society around us. We ask Allah Azza wa Jal to bless our wealth. We asked Allah SubhanAllah to open our hearts to giving it. We asking Allah to purify our hearts from stinginess of our souls. So we'll break and resume with the technical portion of our session insha'Allah. Do you have a Muadhin volunteer?",
      "أشهد أن محمد رسول الله حي على الصلاة",
      "Keep your lines straight. Keep your hearts focused on Allah Azza wa Jal.",
      "Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.",
      "15 minutes from 845 to 9 o'clock p.m. starting tonight Aisha nine o' clock",
      "Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah. InshaAllah we'll continue, I know time is of the essence so I wanted to try and end by six it's going to be very difficult",
      "So we'll see how it goes. During this session, if you have questions related to what I'm speaking about, you can stop and ask me questions. What I'll do actually is, Tamor, you want to take this? If anybody has a question, just raise your hand. You can use the microphone. You obviously just use your voice but if you want the mic, you use the mic. And then we'll go from there. And at the very end, if any specific questions, we can have an open Q&A inshaAllah. Okay. Dr. Muzamil's back. Alhamdulillah.",
      "speak about now is getting into the technical aspects right so now we know okay zakah's important right it's pillar of Islam there's consequences, there's great rewards but really at the end of the day what is zakatable? Right. What is it that we're liable to pay zakah on? What is exempt from our zakah? What are those terms that I've heard before I have to have the nisab, has to be subject to the haul talk about these terminology these terms who pays zakah and then who receives a zakahs will go through each of those inshallah let's start with",
      "zakatable right that is not a it's a word we've made up right as a capital assets so we want to think about the way in Islam people often think that zakah just like you throw all your assets together that's not actually true there are different liabilities for different types of wealth. So what we're gonna do today is we're going to speak about gold silver money liquid kind of accounts kind of one big bucket then there's another bucket of agricultural produce which I will not speak about unless",
      "Sometimes I own a farm in Central Valley, something like that. Then livestock, right? If somebody has free grazing, cows and camels and buffaloes and goats and sheeps, then we can also talk about that. And of course there's real estate, business assets, and jewelry. So all these things will discuss. The first thing to discuss is what do you not have to pay zakat on? Unlike what people often think of your net worth as being kind of what you're liable for, it's not.",
      "All items for personal use are exempt. So your home is exempt. Even if you have two homes, you know, you have a summer home, it's also exempt. Anything you're using for personal benefit and not for business reasons is exempt Your car is exempt, right? Your second car is exactly right. You know, whatever might be here, Lamborghini for the weekends is exempt right? Those things are not liable to zakah as long as you're",
      "into in more detail is jewelry that women are wearing. So again, the three of them will go into detail other than the Hanafis they say that jewelry that woman wear is not liable to Zakah and the Hanafi's will say that it is. So let's quickly talk about two terms we have to understand. The first term is the Nisaab and the second term is Hawl so these are part of the technical criteria.",
      "before they become liable to paying zakat on anything. So, to give an example right someone might have a thousand dollars of money that's their total amount value right we would say they have not met the nisab, they have met the threshold of wealth to be liable pay and what's important is that different asset classes have different types of nisabs so the nissab for again buffalo is different than those nisaba for agricultural produce which",
      "and kind of liquid assets right so the second term is howl and howl refers to not people think of like just a year but specifically a lunar year it's very important because people often say I pay my zakah every whatever January 1st it's not every January 1 has to be on the lunar calendar because this is what we count as the passing of a lunar at year while having the nisab right is how we think about the howl. So this issue",
      "it applies to your money but it does not apply for instance to your agricultural produce right so again nisab is something we're going to think about and there's different nisabs for different asset classes howl is something that we're gonna think about some things have a hell and some things don't have a home all right we'll go step by step but just now we got the two terms in our heads right minimum amount and then passage of time these two things",
      "right because in this case of being a Muslim state or anything else, they would pay jizya instead but Muslims they pay zakah. The one who owns and possesses an isab he's liable for paying zakah the one who has possession of that wealth for a lunar year when applicable has to pay zakat. The person whose debt considerations they're not insolvent their total assets outweigh at least their short-term debts we will talk about long term debt later and I know the difference",
      "position that age is not a requirement. The Hanafis say that you have to be at least of puberty, that even young children who are wealthy have to pay zakah according to the majority of the scholars because the debate is, is zakah a right on the wealth or is it just on the person? So some of the madhhabs say it's the right of the wealth that is subject to zakah and so this case if anyone here has young children whom mashallah have made it, either YouTube celebrities or Twitch celebrities, if they're under 16 or under puberty",
      "have to pay. And also it's important because sometimes what people do is they will distribute wealth amongst their kids and also a way to reduce their liabilities, right? So I'll say okay you know I got a whole lot of money but let me take my money and let me give $100,000 to kid A and $1,000 the kid B and $100K to kid C so now mashallah my kids are very rich but I don't have any money so I don'y have to be any zakah and my kids don't need to pay zakah. No no this is not how it works. You're liable if you own that well. So let's talk about",
      "silver, cash and liquid accounts. So the way that we're gonna think about this is we're going to start with the nisab what is the actual nisb? The Prophet Muhammad and early seerah scholars would establish there's two different common types of nisib and they were tied to the gold and the silver prices at the time. Shaykh al-Qaradawi and many contemporary scholars are of the opinion that because of",
      "that many scholars prefer just using the gold nassab to make life easy. And so, I think this is from like a week or two ago approximately... So the threshold is going to be about 85 grams of gold and 85 grams is equal to about three ounce and each ounce of gold today's about $2,100. So let's just say approximately six thousand dollars you know because it fluctuates every day if somebody owned six thousand",
      "liquid accounts, that would put someone at the nisab. You are now considered wealthy from an Islamic standpoint. Right? You are considered to have the threshold of wealth that makes you amongst those who may have to pay zakah. And so this is going to apply to adding up your savings accounts, your checking accounts. We'll talk about retirement accounts, 401ks, stocks, cash, your PayPal, your Venmo, all those things you pull together. If you have $6,000 and you say I reached a threshold,",
      "Now let's see if a year passes. So that's how we're gonna start so somebody owns $6,000 then you say do I have six thousand dollars one lunar year later now what's important here There's differences of opinion the easy position is don't worry about annual fluctuations So let's just say you had six thousand today Okay, Hamdulillah You reached the nisab today and let's say a month later you got to pay an electricity bill And you drop two five thousand five hundred dollars whatever it might be We don't say your reset",
      "you know, your howl just yet. We would say wait for the entire year and then if that money goes back up and it comes back down, it goes back, up comes back, down as long as a year later lunar year you have six thousand dollars then you have met the condition of the howl. So let's go step by step okay so it's easy to think about cash it's easier to think gold if you have gold bars you have silver you add that together and it has a certain value you pay on that value right? So if it's cash I have ten thousand dollars of cash",
      "right? I've had it for a year, it's very easy to pay 2.5%, right? Pay $250 of zakah. But what about all my other accounts? How do I pay zakah on my stocks? How Do I pay on my retirement accounts, my pension plans? Each of these is important so let's start. So shares the first and most common kind of investment people have as they own stocks and that can be in the form of individual shares that you own. Someone buys shares of Apple Google Tesla any other company that you want now there's two considerations one",
      "is it halal to invest in that company? That's a separate issue. And then the zakat due on it. So whether the company is halal or haram, you still have to pay zakat on it so you could be held liable for investing in a haram company but then you'd be held double liable if you didn't pay zakah on that right. So again for shares allahu alim there are different opinions that are out there. The stock market is called a stock market for a reason now most people when they buy shares of a company",
      "true business owners right anyone here have a share of tesla or apple or anything else right do you feel like you're an owner of those companies no right to you you are like look this is just a commodity that i'm trading it's it could be a pokemon card right it could",
      "it like I'm a business owner and have this equipment here, and I have this rent that I got to pay here. And then you're not running it like a small business owner like if you had a local yogurt land or a local restaurant, you'd calculate life very differently right? So for that reason, I am of the opinion that shares are treated like liquid assets. Whatever the share value is, that is zakat that you own on it. There's a minority of scholars in some of them who would say that you would pay on a portion of that. If you want",
      "later, but I think the safest opinion because of how shares operate in today's economy is you pay on the full value of those shares at the end of the year. So if you bought Apple for $1,000 and now it's worth, I don't know the value, it's $2,000, you just pay at the date after the haul that I owe on the whole value of my shares. Currently yes. The same would apply for mutual funds so mutual funds are simply a bucket",
      "put into by some entity, it could be Amana or something else. Make sure your mutual funds are Sharia compliant and the same thing here if you own that outright you pay on the full value of the mutual fund. The second now we get into more kind of corporation specific things RSUs and ESPP does anybody own these in their companies? So RSU is referred to restricted stock units that's when a company will say I'm giving you shares as part of your compensation so mostly tech companies do this but",
      "your salary is $100,000 and also we're gonna give you a thousand RSUs. So that's interesting because the RSU's anyone have our excuse no I want to make sure it so with RSU as the company is saying your salary proportioned into cash and into shares but those shares you don't own them outright all the time typically with RSE use and if you have your own case you can ask me is they tell you they vest over time so someone",
      "you're getting $100,000 and 1,000 shares. But they vest over four years. What this means is that today I don't have that share in my pocket. One year later, my company will say here's 250 of those. The second year, they give me 250 more. Third year, 250 more the fourth year to 50 more than I have those shares. Until I actually have the shares in my pockets, I don t own them so I don pay Zakat on it. So let's just say again today, I got a new job, the employer said here's 1000 RSUs",
      "RSUs, well six months later if my zakat is due I don't actually have any shares because if I try to sell them there's nothing to sell. They're not in my pocket they're not on my account so only shares that are vested do you pay on. So if it's again a thousand over four years and one year you're into it you'd only be on 250. ESPP is when the company is going to give you a discount to purchase the shares of the corporation you work at. That's really typically will",
      "price in a certain interval of time or it could be 15% off the current price. Again, the same thing here is if once those shares are in your possession and they have vested then again you would pay on the full value of those. So for all these assets of stocks, again the opinion is to pay on",
      "For zakat, two things. One is your ownership and the second thing is accessibility that you are able to use it so those both of these things are there then you see what is the current amount for that",
      "Okay, the second thing to go into is the individual retirement accounts that people often have and this is The IRA accounts are where people take create. They're responsible for their own retirement It's not typically employer based And so you would put money into the IRA sometimes there certain advantages of doing it for tax reasons So on so forth and again the same thing here you would pay the full amount annually Of what your IRA is worth now? It's true the IRA comes with certain restrictions perhaps",
      "on withdrawals right now the opinions here they vary there's two ways to think about it and the same would apply to 401k but I want us to appreciate the fact that this is a voluntary choice. This is really important because there are some retirement accounts you have no choice in like a pension, you can't tell your employer I don't want this I want actually cash in hand it's no you work here this money is going into a pension fund right with IRA years",
      "cash and putting into an account that has its own restrictions because it has certain perks that you want. So in this case, the opinion is if your money is growing in that IRA account, you pay on the full value of the IRA without subtracting anything. The only time you subtract something is if you actually need to subtract it to pay. So what do I mean by that? Let's say someone had $10,000 in their IRA and they had no cash at all. They owe $250 of Zakat, right? Someone's like,",
      "Someone's like, I don't have $250. So now I got to sell part of what's in my IRA account in order for me to pay the $250 If you have to withdraw money from your IRA and that's now subject with some penalties for early withdrawal Then you can subtract that because now you've paid a penalty and that money is actually no longer in your possession so whatever let's just say it went down from 10,000 to 9500 cuz you had to pull out some money and they taxed you I don' know if it's ten percent. So",
      "subtract in the case of realizing that actual loss. So now we move to 401k and it's gonna be a very similar position that I hold on this, and I'll share with you a few of the opinions. So the 401k is an employer-based program and the idea is the government doesn't want to help you for your retirement they want to pass the buck to your employer right? And so they say to the employer hey you know what tell this employee to save and sweeten",
      "on a traditional 401k. Also the company is often matching a certain percentage of your contributions, so there's a lot of perks. So you get pre-taxed contributions, the dollar you put in is worth more right? It could be worth 10%, 20% whatever your tax rate is. Also that employer is matching, so maybe let's say in your case you put 3% or 5% and your employer is",
      "$5,000. Now you have $10,000, right? So there's perks to doing it. The issue that comes up, the 401k is probably the most tricky thing in the United States to understand from a Zakat perspective. The reason is because it is kind of in this hybrid station of ownership and there's many, many opinions on it. Now again, let's distill it to its essence. This is a choice. One is choosing that I want to save for my retirement using this investment vehicle because you could have done something else.",
      "could have done something else what could you have done I could take in my money and put it under my mattress that's one option probably a bad choice because again there's no growth in it right it's just going to be subject to losses over time inflation so on so forth or I could the money and I can put it in the stock market but people don't want to do that because they said well it's post-taxed and post-tax it's already lost some money right and then again no one else is adding to the pot so 401k",
      "that make it more and more desirable. And the same thing I mentioned on stocks, make sure your 401k is halal. This is not like trivial. It's not trivial. Again this is your retirement that you're going to live on from inshallah your old age. Make sure that the 401k that your company is offering you is permissible which means the assets within them are permissible right? They're not investing in companies that are haram have a number of bonds all these other types",
      "So there's a couple opinions. So one of them is, and this is the position I hold, anything that is fully vested in your 401k because again vesting applies sometimes the corporation says we'll match for you but it takes time so if we put in $5,000 you cannot quit right away and take that 401k with you so it takes to vest whatever is vested is fully yours my opinion and many other scholars in Southern California as you pay on the full amount of vested assets",
      "of vested assets that's the first opinion why because you own the wealth you are choosing to have it in that account and it is growing and so some of the conditions of wealth that is zakatable uh is that it is liable to grow reliable to grow doesn't have to grow so in this case the wealth is li able to grow and you are benefiting from it how are you benefiting you've cho you you've chosen i want this money",
      "the benefit. The benefit is long-term financial security, right? The second opinion that the Council of North America and AMJA give is that you may subtract your penalties and your taxes. And the logic that those organizations give is today if my 401k is worth $100,000 and I wanted to go and spend my 401K, I couldn't do that. So how much would",
      "I wanted to go and buy a new car, right? Or want to go put it for a down payment on my house. Well you would be subject number one to a 10% penalty so if you pulled out at $100,000 the government say I need ten thousand of that as a penalty for your early withdrawal. So now you have only ninety thousand dollars. Now you take that ninety thousand dollar and add it to your normal income let's just say your income was hundred thousand dollars so now you",
      "let's just say it was 25%, right? So now you're going to actually take 25% out of that $90,000. And so again, now you are left with 70-some thousand dollars in this case, right? In this example, you would now have to pay zakat on that leftover portion after 10% and after your taxes, right. I know some people make exaggerated claims as if they take out half of it because 10% plus a maximum tax rate of 40%. This is not accurate because first of all nobody pays the full 40% in taxes",
      "set in taxes and it's not realistic. The other reason why I find this position to not also make sense is that even if you have to withdraw, right? Typically you should say what do you have withdraw to pay your zakat on so it makes more sense in my opinion to say well I had a hundred thousand dollars of 401k and I have to pay my zakat it's $2,500 right? So I'll show you the examples",
      "penalties and taxes may apply. And so I'll go through that in more detail, I'll quickly move to pension. So for the pension according to the typical pensions that people have in certain government sectors that no one has to pay Zakat until they actually begin receiving income on it because you don't have access to that wealth at any point in time, you cannot pull it out, it is completely out of your hands until a certain point in history once you can receive that income you now treat that as ordinary income that just gets put into your normal asset classes right",
      "asset classes right so yes sister question yeah good question so trust funds are a little bit different so this is a trust for like a child as an example or an adult okay so the idea here is if somebody has a trust fund and they have access to that trust then it's fully liable to pay zakat on so my parents have given me you know a million dollars in",
      "anytime I want to, will have to pay zakat on the million dollars that I have in my trust. If there are certain restrictions, there's things we can speak about. So let's quickly walk through the 401k just to give you some really detailed stuff because I know it's tricky and I'm going to be speaking here, I'm gonna put my hat on as not a financial advisor, I am wearing the cap of the faqih so there is a difference. There's something that fiqh I believe is the right thing to do or the safe thing to",
      "you want. So let's just be clear, so alhamdulillah today we have a different type of a 401k and that is called a Roth 401k. So I want to talk about both of these. Anyone's company offer them a Roth? If you don't know you should ask your company because actually it is important. What is the difference in the traditional 401k when you put money into your retirement account it is coming out pre-tax right so the government has not yet skimped anything off",
      "right into the retirement account. Now in this case what ends up happening is the contributions are subtracted from your taxable income for the year so again this year you made a hundred thousand dollars but you put five thousand dollars in your 401k, so the government says you're only liable to paying ninety-five thousand dollars of income tax rate now what happens is when you're fifty nine and a half years old you can begin to withdraw and what you withdraw you pay the nominal tax rate bond",
      "and I'm getting no income, but I'm pulling from my 401k. Let's say I pulled $100,000 a year for my 401K. How much do I pay in taxes? Anyone know? It's not nothing. It's your nominal tax rate. So now when you report and you need your taxes, you'd say my income was $100 thousand dollars and my dependents and my liability, all the standard things we do in taxes. So probably you're gonna pay 10%, 15%. It depends on how many kids you have. It depends whether you have a mortgage.",
      "depends on so many factors that the tax code is going to figure out. So, the point I'm making here is that it is variable. You have no idea what percent of tax you're going to pay when you retire. It could be zero, it could be 40%. How can it be 40%? If someone retired and said now I have $5 million in my 401k, I want to pull it out and I want buy a home on the beach. Well if you pull out that $5,000,000 the government's gonna tax you on $5 billion of income",
      "you know, $2 million of that or something to the government. So now I'm going to have only $3 million. You could be paying zero and you could be being 40%. Huge variability. So I want you think about how you plan to spend your retirement. Some people say I'm gonna rent forever and then buy a home in my retirement. some say I own my home, I'm just gonna pull out, you know $5,000 a month for my living. This matters because it's gonna affect your liability. So, I wanna say a couple things that are important cause they're misunderstood. People think that",
      "You can't touch your 401k. It's not true. You can touch your 401K, there are two or three ways you can do it. One of them is the government allows you to give yourself a loan. So you're allowed to give your self alone but they like to discourage you because if you could take out a loan on yourself people would say I'll keep borrowing money for myself right? So the government says no no when you take out alone from yourself and they give you up to $50,000 you have to pay yourself back in interest okay this",
      "is not interest from the Islamic sense. So imagine I pulled out a thousand dollars and the government said you got to pay yourself back one thousand one hundred dollars, okay? I can do that right they're only doing that to kind of disincentivize you to withdraw from your 401k because they don't want you to have to pull out welfare in the future. That's the reason why now this is important because if someone had to pull money for their zakah you don't have to pay a penalty or you don'y have to you know this exorbitant taxes on it. You",
      "And then you can pay yourself back later on if you had to, right? The second thing is when you're older, you can also roll your 401k over into an IRA again and not see some of those tax liabilities. So I'm saying all of this to get people out of the worst case scenario which is oh my god 50% of my money's gonna be taken away let's reduce 50%of my liabilities, right that's not accurate in my opinion. Now why am i advocating that you consider the Roth 401k? The reason I advocate for the Roth",
      "So the government took 25 cents out of my dollar and I was able to put 75 cents now into my 401k this year. But here's what ends up happening, I will never pay tax on that ever again. So if I pay Zakat on my Roth today, I have paid the exact amount that I owe with no ambiguity it's not more it's less. With a traditional 401k you might be paying more or you might",
      "So the financial advisor tells you if you're in a higher tax bracket today, then you will be in the future. Then you should have a traditional 401k because your tax liability right now is greater so you want to reduce that and in the futre you'll be in a lower tax bracket and so you're going to get that advantage. The Roth 401k's flipped. If you're actually in a low bracket today and you're gonna be in",
      "wrath is easier. Again, I don't know what's good for your dunya. All I know is what's the safety of it is wrath you have zero ambiguity right? No penalty right? For yeah yeah because you've already paid the tax. Your taxes already been paid right and so you can usually withdraw your own contributions right after a period of time so again there's less you're less stuck in this thing right? So again",
      "If you want to put yourself in an investment vehicle that's going to limit your access, that's your choice. But it's your choic. Like if I told my... Imagine I told Dr. Mazzoma, I said, Dr. Mazama, I trust you a lot. I don't trust myself with my retirement money. I'm gonna start spending it. Dr.Mazama take my retirement mone and don't let me have it until I'm 60 years old. And now I tell you guys, you know what? I'm not liable to pay Zakat because I don' t have access to my money. Who would think that's reasonable? Nobody right?",
      "But why do we do that with 401k? Because Charles Schwab has my money. So now it's okay because I can't touch it. Charles Schwob won't let me touch it.\" Like you told Charles Schwb not to give it to you, right? So you have chosen this and you are gaining all the benefits of it. So when do you deduct from your 401k only if you realize those penalties in taxes. So let's go through a scenario. So this only applies if you have about two million dollars in your 401K",
      "401k okay because below that you wouldn't be subject to this and I can explain why. Also if you have no cash on hand, this may be a consideration. So if you $100,000 in your 401k what this means is that you owe $2,500 if we take our nominal rate of 2.5%. So now you have a few choices either you pay it from your checking account or you pay",
      "But if you had no cash at all, all your money was in your 401k. And there are people like this in our community. They live check to check. All the money is in the retirement account. Well, guess what? You still have to pay. So you would have to withdraw from your 401K, but you don't withdraw $100,000. You would say, well, I have to withdrawal probably I owe $2,500. So if you withdrew 3,000, you'd pay a 10% penalty assuming. So again why do I say two million dollars plus typically under 2 million dollars your Zika is less than 50,000",
      "is less than $50,000. And so you can give yourself a loan. So you wouldn't be in this scenario. But if you're at that high level, let's just take this example, you would pay 10% of a penalty, so you lose $300. And then you'd pay, let' sjust say about 20% in taxes on the remainder, that's $540 right? So in this senario your zakah liability has dropped from 100,000 to 99,160 and now instead of owing 2500 you owe 2479 dollars",
      "But the point I'm making is, it's actually very minimal. How much money did I save in zakah by subtracting my taxes and penalty? How much? $21, right? It's not worth the headache guys. Just again have yaqeen that Allah will bless your wealth if you do what's right. I've had nobody ever come to me in 10 plus years of doing this say sheikh, I'm broke now",
      "Because again, you have a million dollars and you owe $25,000. So if you had a million in your 401, you owe 25 thousand dollars But your 401 is growing more than two-and-a-half percent a year typically right? So alhamdulillah if you have to pay twenty five thousand dollars in zakat on it Alhamdulilah inshallah next year you have pay thirty thousand Hopefully the next year to pay forty thousand that means your money's growing That means your Money is growing at an extent that is very good, right?",
      "because this is what takes people hours. All right? We're good? Okay, I'm doing it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know. Yeah?",
      "Yeah. It does. So the question is, so this is a very specific scenario. So I want to talk to two groups of people quickly. First group, I'm going to speak to you if you don't have millions of dollars in your 401k. If you're young and you're starting",
      "career what you're supposed to do my advice is make sure that you put money into your investments and you keep liquid assets available it's just smart so okay i have ten thousand dollars in my 401k I've also got cash on hand so I don't have to dip into it that's a smart thing to do. Your scenario is where someone didn't know this and now they're in their 40s or their 50s and their 60s say oh my god I have three four million dollars in",
      "talk offline, we can talk about how do you do this after your retire. That's a correction and an exception it's not the normative rule. And this position comes up because there's a minority position that says you don't have to pay on your 401k until you retire but there's big problem with this first I will say this and some and they split this opinion into two one so you have to play on every single year so you started saving at 25",
      "Now, every single year. Year one maybe it was $2,000. Year two it was 3,000 and then 40,000 50,000 60,000 that lump sum when you retire you have to pay half a million dollars in zakat? That's a huge fitna to somebody's deem right? So I think that is just a very dangerous proposition to be in and it's a debt over your shoulder so this is one of the opinions right? Clarify?",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would just say start from this year. Because if you adopt a new position, you're not liable to your previous position, especially if that position was from a respected scholar. So we're not here to nitpick and say someone's wrong or right. It's just what your heart believes, you start practicing that today, and you just go with that inshallah. We can talk offline for the details. Okay, so I want to quickly... Oh, question.",
      "Question. Yeah. If somebody has the non-shariah compliant by the employer, in that scenario for example the amount vested amount is 10k. Just an example employee and employer invested amount is about 10k and the account full value is about 15000k. Okay. So zakat will be on 10k or 15k?",
      "the 15k in consideration that the person having the 15 k he will purify the money by giving the sadaka without intention of reward. That is one of the way of purification so that additional 5000s so zakat will be on the 15K or only the 10 K with a person considering that that is his own money, the additional 5,000 once he will withdraw the 401k yeah he will give like a sadaka",
      "Okay, Jazakumullahu khair. So there's two things here. So one is again the question is imagine that somebody part of that wealth was not halal right because they know that looks in this case let's just say a third of the wealth was bonds as an example it's probably not realistic but let's to say it was do that money is haram for me to take in its totality but it's in my account so what I'm going to do is when I you know when I have a chance from that $15,000 I only own 10,000 of it 5,000 if it actually is I can't take ownership of it so in",
      "okay, now at 5,000 I'm going to donate it completely because it's not like zakah. It's not even something you're rewarded for. Right? It's just something you have to purify. Then you'd say, I have 10,000 left. Now he pays the count on the 10,001. You don't want to get double hit right? Okay jewelry really fast. That money can be given to poor Muslims as well. Yeah. Does it have to be given somebody who is from that Islam great. Not to go, not to masjid. Don't give to masjd.",
      "Okay, so for jewelry we're gonna separate really fast. If your jewelry is for business purposes then again the three of them that have considered part of your zakatable... if it's for business purpose everyone agrees that it's liable for zakaah. This would be if somebody sold jewelry online at an eBay marketplace you know something else or a jewelry store. So you would pay on the value of that merchandise right? If it's gold right you know you've taken",
      "The intention in this case is if it's, if the intention is to make money now you have to pay on it right and utensils and cups that are gold as well like pure gold they're actually haram to own and use but you still have to pays Zakah on that. Right? The second side where no zakah is due is again personal jewelry that is worn by women for adornment So again You've got wedding jewelry And you wear it once in a while to a wedding or a party Again three madhahib say you do not have to Pays Zakah out on that",
      "say you have to pay zakat on it. So again I will just say if you're a Hanafi and you've been paying on your jewelry, you have no problem with it by all means pay on it right but again three-fourths of the madahib would say that is not liable because again it is no longer considered as a growth asset. It's not considered as wealth. Because you don't care whether that is worth $1,000 or $100,000. It sentimental, it is a gift, it adornment, it's family heirloom. But if the intention ever changed so imagine someone had this expensive",
      "it every year to their dawats and their shadis. And then one year they're like, wait a minute, this is actually worth a whole lot now. I want to sell it. Once the niya becomes business, then it becomes liable to paying zakat on. So if it's worth a lot of money, you have to pay 2.5% again on that. Questions? Yeah. Nope. That's okay. Personal use, there's no zakat",
      "to wear your da'wat? No zikr on it. No, even the Hanafis wouldn't say you have to. Hanafi's is gold and silver so your Rolex watch is not gold or silver hopefully right yeah. Yeah questions on the... And again part of the logic that some of those stories they have about this is like if a sister had gold imagine you had a set of gold right and you're not working especially right okay like you have the nice necklace set you got the earrings",
      "Again, it's difficult to separate this type of an asset. So again for the Hanafis you would just pay the value of it, right? The weight of the gold, you'd weigh it and say what does that come out to? And I'll pay 2.5% of the value. And even those who are Hanafi if the women have some jewelry husband can pay for them. Husband can pay Zakat for them",
      "In time is running, we need to know who's actually entitled to get the zakat. Almost there, inshallah. Okay. Business. Really fast. So what do you have to pay if you own a business? You have to play on your merchandise or your inventory and that could be raw materials or otherwise. If you had like wood or metal or any other cotton that is liable it's part of your assets. And any accounts that you have. What you don't pay on is any fixed assets.",
      "equipment, you know furniture, the facility. Anything that's fixed in this case you don't pay on. The issue of account receivables and payables there is a lot of opinions on it some scholars say consider all your account receivable deduct all your accounts payable I personally have changed my opinion over the years I think just do what you have in hand at the moment because its easier to calculate cause you don' t have to worry about did someone default or not default like what you had in your hands at that moment likely there is money that will come out",
      "money that's going to come out, there's money that is gonna come in just deal with it on your strike date whatever day you pay zakat on. Take your foot year at whatever you own from your business and you pays a count on it the only thing I'll add is just be careful not to be like I know those people who will then as a possibility of kind of deception where for instance they will have a whole lot of let's say account receivables that you know are supposed to come in that they're not liable for and so they've kind of set up their zakah at a time where it's like it minimizes their liability so we don't want to do that right",
      "Real estate, to be honest real estate is probably the hardest thing to speak about. I don't feel comfortable with the current opinions but they are what they are. Question? Yeah. Yeah that's why I'm saying don't worry about that like you don't want to",
      "saying, hey you know what I got these 10 customers that owe me this much money over the next 30 days and also owe these other customers money over next 30 day. Just do it with what's there in the moment in time. Let those account because likely they're going to cancel each other out to a certain extent. That's okay. Because it's just at that moment in times because again there's some ambiguity. You don't know if that account receivables is gonna be actually received right?",
      "Say it one more time. Yeah. I would say pay it on the $100 because you haven't actually paid it out yet, right? It's owed but someone else is probably going to owe you and you probably have these receivables. So I'm saying these doors are coming in and out. They likely cancel each other out. You can make your life easy.",
      "can make your life easy. If someone is elaborate at accounting, by all means you're welcome to take all your receivables and all your payables as well so both opinions are valid I was just trying to make life easy because I know that it can be very cumbersome to do this and then there's formulas to calculate what's the likelihood of it being paid off because some people have customers that will pay some more customers who won't pay there's all kinds of ambiguities in that as well right? So if you have that question we can speak privately inshallah. Real estate the general opinion",
      "business reasons like you're flipping houses, you own those houses right? You are liable to paying on the value of those houses. But if it's rental income then the dominant position to this day is simply you take the rental income and you count that as part of your ordinary income and pay on it. And you don't pay on property that you either live in or has a non-business intention so maybe land you've purchased, you want to build a home on it but you're still saving up money but it's got a residential or personal NIA behind it right?",
      "rental income you can deduct taxes repair expenses anything that you have now you can detect that and then whatever is your real income yeah so if you're getting every month let's just say five thousand dollars of rental income it's sixty thousand in the year but you have to pay property tax from that you know all kinds of other things whatever at the end you have just becomes part of your total zakat liabilities right I will be honest I feel like especially with",
      "real estate has become very strange. Be mindful though, I feel like real estate could become a zakah shelter so just be make sure that you're not buying your real estate to avoid zakah liabilities right? Because again a million dollar home someone said oh i'm going to buy a house and just rent it out right now essentially because now you don't have to pay $25 000 a year in zakah right so just being mindful of what your niya is and if your niyaya changes again to wanting to sell that home then it switches to the full liability on the house right yes",
      "No zakah. Nope, you're welcome to have multiple homes as long as they are personal residences there's no zakat on them right? The only consideration there again is where Allah swt talks about in the Quran is that be moderate if the person's consumption of personal things like cars and homes makes them unable",
      "Right? Because someone, and we have these scenarios. You know people who make hundreds of thousands of dollars annually who never pays a car because they just live very, very large. So they're always buying new cars. They're always buy new furniture. They are always buying things. Especially never having even the nisab. This is blameworthy. Okay I'm going to skip livestock and grazing unless there's, let's quickly questions. Yes sister.",
      "It's just rental income, correct? Yes. Yes but in which way so that business what are you doing with it if you're renting",
      "somebody else or you're using it for your own business? Yeah if you're Using it for Your Own Business that's gonna be a fixed asset so you can deduct, for instance, if there's any investment that goes into that. You don't have to pay on the value of that space yeah because you're not that's that's not growing that's Not like...yeah yeah you know you don't worry about that",
      "Yeah. No, you would... So in this case, you have to pay off the loan, right?",
      "right so you have to give back the government you know whoever the entity the debtor is and so now you have 300 000 left that goes into your total assets now if you use it to buy another home you don't pay any zika on it but if that money's just sitting as profit in your bank account when your hell comes about you got to count the three hundred thousand dollars okay so just really quick just to show you i won't go into the details but just just so you understand it visually so two and a half percent was the rate for cash",
      "cows or buffaloes, right? You would pay one 1-year old buffalo, right, or cow as a zakah. So again that's not 2 and a half percent. And for sheep and goats in this case you had 40 of them you would pay like one of those, right. So if that doesn't apply to you we can move on. Agriculture is another thing also the nisab is different it no longer has a dollar amount its kilograms its weight so it's 600 kilograms worth of that agricultural produce there's no haul because you don't want to hold 600 kilograms of apple",
      "maybe cosmic crisp it'll last right but generally you know these uh fruits and vegetables don't last so you actually pay on the day of the harvest as allah says in the quran right to haqquhu yawm al-hasad so if you have 600 kilograms of an asset class of agriculture when i say an asset classes like you can add grains together right you can ad,e like if you ave apples you add all different apples together you don't say each variety is different then",
      "if you incur no irrigation cost. In other words, the rain is or local river there's no water that you've incurred of cost then you would pay 10% but if you have to pay the cost of irrigation you pay 5%. So that's for agricultural produce right? So now we get into the question and I will try to wrap it up soon who gets zakah Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala delineates in the Quran eight categories in Surat At-Tawbah he says",
      "So let's walk through these eight predefined categories that Allah tells us about. So the first two are very similar, the poor and the needy. And I also want to just remind us the hadith of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ were almost always emphasizing the poor in the need as a primary recipients of zakah. These other categories are there but they're,",
      "kind of follow along from that need. So the scholars, they differ. Some say the poor and needy, there's a slight distinction. The faqir versus the miskeen who is he? Some say that the faqeer is the one who has nothing. Maybe like a homeless person as an example. No home, no job. Versus the miskin is needy. Maybe they have a home but they don't have enough money for food or they don' t have enough for their electric bill or water bill. The point is poor and",
      "Yes, has to be a Muslim. I know that yeah there's one scholar was respected I know who permits it for non-muslims the vast vast majority of ulama in Islamic history have said Zakat is only for Muslims so i would say we stick with that opinion right your sadaqat for the non-Muslims no problem right? So the third category",
      "of zakat collection. Now this is again important historically. In Islamic history, it was common for the state, the khilafah to have employees whose job was to go to people's farms and to go these places and actually do an account. Oh you have a farm of animals let me go and lets do an acount and give us what you need or you have agricultural produce we'll come drive to your farms during harvest season",
      "So there's people employed to collect those assets. We don't have that today, right? Inshallah we'll have it in the near future, may Allah bring back that Islamic state that does this but here we don't know how that, we don'y have a state, let me finish and come back to you. So right now what we have is... And so this is important because even when it came historically people would not go into peoples bank accounts like the Islamic State wouldn't go into your bank account and be like take your cash and you would give that cash on your own accord to the poor in your community. Today there are individuals",
      "and there's organizations who want to then distribute Zakat. And so they're doing that voluntarily, right? And they're not doing it as any sort of representatives of the state. It's like an IRS job. If the IRS is being paid by the government, their IRS employee, they're getting money to collect taxes. But if someone...if I come around and say let me collect taxes from you guys, I can't take a salary for that. So the opinion of many scholars is that we do not give...",
      "When you give money, try to give it to an organization that doesn't take overhead for their zakah. That's the preferred opinion because this way you know that every dollar you give is getting to the poor. The dilemma we have today again just to give a more... It's good to make the examples direct. Imagine I came to you and I... Make a distinction between عَمِلِينَ عَلَيْهَا وَعَمَلِنَ لَهَٰ",
      "organizations are the people who are authorized to determine your zakat they go and check it and tell you that you have to give this much then nobody employed by any charitable organization and does that if they only collect whatever you will yourself so they are not appointed",
      "just helping the organization. So they are workers for the organization and if they're paid by the organization, they are paid like any other servant, any other worker that they pay. Yeah so to give that example more explicitly, imagine I give this seminar and then I say you know I know a lot of poor people so why don't you guys all give me your zikr and I'll go give it to the poor people in the community but I'm gonna take",
      "How many of you would feel comfortable in giving me your zakah? Say no, like I can go give it to the poor people too right. I don't need you as a middleman to do that right so it's so my best opinion is give it these organizations that guarantee 100% they're gonna transfer this over but then give those organizations sadaqa to cover their overhead because they need sadaquat in order to cover that overhead how do they pay their employees right like has got to come from somewhere so if you give to local charity right please give sadaqua as well as to give zaka and also",
      "will also collect zakat and then their staff that's being paid through sadaqah, we'll distribute that as well. So make sure you can try to give it to those organizations because or else really its quite egregious sometimes organizations are taking 10, 20, 30, 40 percent America is notorious for bad non-profits in terms of the dollar that goes to the needy so you want to just cut that out if you can which is why it's important honestly some of the ulama especially when it comes to things like zakat al fitr are actually very strict they say go and give it in hand",
      "the wisdom is why they say this. It's important for us to be connected to poor people, right? The fact that you live a life where you don't know a poor person is a little bit of an indictment about your lifestyle and your social circle, right, that you are only in a certain group of people so if you can go to those communities in hand and give it to them that is very easy. It eliminates again that unnecessary lack of efficiency that occurs when we have mega organizations who take the zakah, have gigantic galas and banquets that cost massive overhead, right and then it gets transferred over",
      "it gets transferred over. Yeah, the local one that I know that does this very well is Uplift Charity does it very well. I know, I believe Sabeel in Irvine does this well. There's a CAP program out of some of these masjids. Of course, the masjid here will do that. So usually smaller organizations can",
      "And they're not dependent on the types of mechanisms to raise money. So try to find those organizations. That's not Zakat eligible. Yeah, but they're giving money to the Muslims so you're not giving your Zakat to them. What is it? Yes. I don't know helping hands.",
      "I don't know about their overhead policy. So ask, it's your job to make sure your zakah is going to the right people. So you can call and you can ask and say does 100% of my zakah go to the poor? Or do you take overhead? And if they take overhead and you want to give it to them just make sure you give enough sadaqa that covers that portion.",
      "Okay, so let's go through this quick. I know we're over time, so I'll go fast. So the fourth category is Mu'allafat al-Qulub and that was used historically by the Islamic State as well to strategically give it in places that would be beneficial to the state of Islam. So it could be to get people to come closer to Islam who are on the verge of converting but there are certain impediments",
      "those tribes would bring them closer to Islam. It could be used to repel harm, where there's a tribe that is very hostile towards Islam and through giving them the gift of Zakah they would reduce their hostility and that again is a net benefit to the society so there are circumstances where that can be used it's again typically state administered. There are some circumstances where I could see being applied today like there's cases we have a convert who someone wants to convert but if they convert they will let's say their parents will cut them off right and so Zakah in this case",
      "come into Islam and feel like they have that security. The fifth category is freeing slaves and captives, again this could be prisoners of war anyone else who's stuck in a predicament that that they could be taken out of. The sixth is those who are in debt and this refers people who are genuine debts so again not paying off someone's mortgage right that I have a million dollar mortgage but no it's like you know someone has a small loan right that loan they defaulted on right and to help them take care",
      "the big category we can talk about for ages is Sabirullah. It's a most disputed category, some of the councils have opened up the meaning of that to allow it for certain other endeavors but traditionally it was meant to mean jihad and the physical defense of Islam and Muslims and some madhhab would say that applies to Hajj as well so pay to someone who's poor to go on a literal path to Allah like the Hanbalis I will caution again it's a big pet peeve of mine I've papers written",
      "purposely said there was eight categories. He didn't just say that zakah is feeza billah, he could have said that and then you can give zakah to whatever you want. So bluntly it doesn't make sense to be like well all good causes are zakah eligible let me give it to the local Islamic school, let me get into this organization or that organization in the local masjid. And by the way some people do it for masjids. Dr. Muzamal and I we know very clear on this. The masjad is not a place... You don't wanna give zakat to yourself so I love coming to the masjd",
      "And if I give zakah to the masjid, I'm giving money, zakah, to myself. This is forbidden. So I know there's opinions that are out there. I find them to be incredibly odd and strange that you give zakat to organizations that you're the direct beneficiary of. So please try and restrict sabirullah. There's some flexibility, of course here and there but it doesn't mean anything good you can give zakath for. The last category to briefly mention is those who have wealth but may have no access to it.",
      "And the needy, these are the priority. And if there is some area where people are poor and needy most of them are poor or needy and they have a masjid there or they need a masjd then in that case zakat can be given to that area even though we don't get the zakat for building the masjids but because",
      "about this idea that you could have wealth but currently don't have access to it so one could use the capital purposes. So I want to quickly move through, so what do we do now? We know who gets it how do we give it to them there's some things to consider number one is there's a strong preference in Islamic law all of them with that hip by giving it locally when possible. So the reason why as we generate the money here we live here and we have obligations of the poor closest to us so please try to give as much of your zakat locally as possible. I do believe especially",
      "where there's dire circumstances, for instance, there is no rich people in Gaza to give zakah back to other people in the Gaza or these places. If one wants to give it to those circumstances they can but try in your heart to say first and foremost I want to give to my community and then a portion of it maybe I'll give to other places. Second prioritize family members that are genuinely in need so if you have brothers and you have sisters and aunts and uncles cousins who are poor they're both poor and they're your families",
      "But you cannot give it to people who are directly above you in lineage or directly below you. So, you cannot gives a Zakat to your poor parents or your poor grandparents or your children, right? But it can be someone who's kind of parallel so aunts uncles cousins are fine. So again, give it like we said to the poor first, give It to an organization that promises 100%, give it immediately try not to delay And it is okay again to give it early if you need to. So if there was some circumstance like a disaster and you say my Zakat is not due till next month or six months",
      "month or six months you could actually pay your zakat early and just count that in advance a couple other things that are important zaka is charity and people know that it is human beings have dignity right and there's so many ayahs in the quran about this even people who wanted to you know who want to fight for the sake of allah azza wajal who didn't have anything right and people had that dignity and the prophet and the qur'an talks about like don't strip that dignity from people right that allah says there's",
      "and they're in genuine need. So you don't have to tell the person that you're giving money to, that it's zakah money if you know they're eligible. You know a poor person in the community, you have a poor relative. You can just give them a gift and your niya is zakah but they have no idea that it is zakat because if they knew it was zakah they might reject it for instance right? It can be given incrementally if necessary so you might say okay I owe $10,000 of zakah this year, I know someone who needs it but if i gave him ten thousand dollars they may not use it well rather all let's",
      "you know, every month I'll give them $1,000 as an example. The recipient generally should be in control of that zakah so like it's not strings attached and then the last thing I want to say is please don't give zakah to able-bodied people who don't wanna work this is actually common especially in recessions so you do have people who are lost their jobs very common middle upper class people I've dealt with this many cases brothers in IT they come to me Shaykh I lost my job can I have some zakah money right?",
      "And I said, well have you been unable to find a job? It's like, well, you know, I've gotten offers but they're not what I wanted so I turned them down. So I dealt with these real cases right because people again have their dignity so it's like well I'm not going to accept – I used to make $120,000 a year. Well now that there is a recession I've been offered 100, I'm no going to go down so I'll keep rejecting those jobs until I get the job that's going to give me what I want. I'd say – I told this to people. I said go bag groceries and when you show me that you are working hard then go drive Uber do anything you have to do to make ends meet then whatever is left over we can give",
      "give. So someone has to exert their effort, then they can collect zakah right after that. Last couple things I know I yeah let's just end on we'll end on this uh i just want us to i like to make people dream because i think that sometimes we get bogged down in our personal lives and i've done this over a number of years and every time i do it people tell me you're underestimating but it's okay because that means it's even greater. Just think about how many Muslims live in Southern California right? California is one of the most densely populated Muslim regions in America",
      "in America and I did this projection so we assumed that there was you know 5,000 people in our community right who had $50,000 as a guy liability right that's reasonable right yeah all of Southern California right they're five thousand Muslims maybe 50,000 dollars is the guy liability I think it's not a problem those people would generate about six million dollars as a cop just amongst them he said there's three thousand people at one hundred thousand dollars of Zakat liability",
      "If you just go down this list, there's 2,000 people with half a million dollars. If we went through this and by the way I know that there's I know people in the community who are worth more than 50 billion dollars so I know I'm underestimating here but just in my calculation here we would easily have about 100 million dollars of Zaka in Southern California. Easily. Would we have any poor people? In this case? Probably not right?",
      "Right. So just if the Muslims of California were put their heads together, paid Zakat properly we would likely be able to alleviate just our own local poverty right? No poor Muslims in Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Los Angeles so this is the power of the Sharia. This is the Power of following the guidance of Allah Azza wa Jal If We follow it we will see those fruits and then you see the fruits that will increase you in Yaqeen and Iman but You have to",
      "but you have to, again, start with yourself. And yes, you might say not everyone is doing it. You start and it becomes contagious. Alhamdulillah over the years as we do these seminars, we get people who come up to me after the seminar. They say, Sheikh, I didn't know this. Literally someone said he makes like $30 million a year. And he's like, I thought zakah was just going to the banquet and writing a check. I never calculated it. I might write a $10,000 check and I'm done. I thought that was zakah. It's like sadaqah. He says no, it's 2.5% every year.",
      "Okay, so now like his zakah is going to be substantial right? So as we educate one another and encourage one another Right that pool will go up. And inshallah I mean, I pray that we live in a day, right We have no poor muslims in california, right? And then we can take our zakah and then transfer it over to another community and another community another community So we ask allah azza wa jal to increase us in our wealth We ask allahu make us amongst those who give zakah that it purifies us It purifies our wealth it purify our families",
      "Let me fully close, then people can leave. And after that we'll do questions. If you need to leave, I know we're getting closer to iftar time and everything else. Feel free to leave. It's open Q&A now, inshallah.",
      "So the question is, when you ask people for donations for the masjid, it is important that we tell people and educate them that you don't give zakat to the masjd. Now if someone in their heart is like I don't care what you say, I'm going to give my zakat of the masjed. Yeah? Yes. Yes. This is better.",
      "No, typically you don't use zakat for like burying the dead. That's not that's typically not Sure welcome dr. Mazamil appreciate it So as you we know that's a prevalent asset is",
      "prevalent asset in California and Southern California. Most people have properties, some of them have multiple properties. A lot of them how you have accumulated tens of millions of dollars in equity. Yes. And some of whom plan to pass it on to their heirs and when they do, you know, they get it at the stepped up basis so therefore there's no taxable tax consequence I'm not sure about those account but should these",
      "income, rental income as well plus building equity which is supposedly a business but it's a passive business. What zakat are they required to pay and how and when? Yeah that's a very good question and again this is why I said to you earlier with all my research I'm the most uncomfortable with the current fiqh of real estate and you have to understand why historically in the history of humanity from the time of the Prophet",
      "of the Prophet, real estate was not a business early on. Like land was not, like in Medina when the Prophet Muhammad was in Medinah and people want land for houses it's take what you want. It's an open city, grab your land, you just have to build your home. So I believe if I forgot the exact date but it's almost 100 years into the history of Islam before people would rent places. That's like so think about this is that the history",
      "considering real estate as like a cash cow, right? People would, because land would not appreciate, right, and people don't want to have their money stuck in something that's not going to appreciate. And to be very honest even if you go to the Midwest to this day I'll give you a very explicit example, right. I have a family member who owned their home for over a decade in Minneapolis and the house appreciated like two percent in a decade. So why would someone buy a home in Minneapolis for real",
      "everything is upside down. So the dilemma here is that all of the traditional fiqh says that when you buy a property, now let's just say to pay 2.5% on the house as an example so you bought a rental home for $1 million and you rent it out for $3,000 a month as an examples, your zakat on that house would be $25,000 per year",
      "it would actually nullify almost all of your rental income as well, right? So something about paying like historically there was no notion that paying the full ownership of the land. So the tricky here now we have to figure out is what might be more reasonable. So one of the things I think we can consider as an avenue is to pay a percentage of the actual produce. So why do I say this when you own agricultural land, why did people buy farms? You buy a farm and the farm could be $1 million",
      "million dollars but then you pay zakah on what grows from it right and you give like five percent or you give ten percent right i think it might make more sense for us to consider something like giving a fixed percentage of what is growing from that property so for instance let's say it's rental income rather than including the rental income as general income you just take a percentage of it and give it in zakah the problem is that the fiqh has not developed that fast yet because again very regional so i don't want",
      "So I would say that for people, the safest thing to do is in your case you're saying people will have multiple houses. What is their Nia is the key thing here. If the Nia this is a business like thing yes, I'm renting it out today but my goal is my deep Nia it's appreciation if that's the deeper Nia, I think you should pay on the full value of the house because that's why you bought the home Would you have bought that same home if it was not going to increase?",
      "going to increase. And just for the sake of rental income? If the answer is yes, then you pay on the rental income. If you say no, I'm buying it because of the appreciation that I think you should pay on value of the home. That's how I think I resolve currently the dilemma. Wallahu'alam. Other questions? Where does 2.5% come from? Oh, the Prophet, as he said, give 1 20th. Yeah. 1 20 th of that asset.",
      "So this is the formula. The formula you have ultimately, let me show it to you, is this. Your zakat du is your zakatable assets minus your loans. But the loans are actually split into two. You have to think about long-term loans and short-term loan. A short term loan is less than a year. You owe somebody within this year. If it's a short term one, you can deduct the whole loan. Let me give you an explicit example. I have $10,000 in my bank account but I owe you $5,000 due this year",
      "due this year? When I'm calculating, and let's just say that next month is my zakat is due. But I still owe you $5,000 like very, very soon. I would subtract, I'd say I have $10,000 but I owe you 5,000 so now I only have $5K. Actually don't pay any zakah. That's a short term loan. What if I owed you $5000 but I owed it to you over 10 years? Now I owe actually only $500 this year. So I'd only subtract",
      "So just to show you a way to do it, this is simple. I'll walk you guys through it. Let's take a couple scenarios. So scenario one, somebody had $25,000 in the beginning of Ramadan. So yes or no? Do they have the nisab? Yes. Okay, now let's say what happens a year later? So six months in, they bought a car for $22,000 cash. Now they only own $3,000. So now they're technically below the nesab but we're actually not going to restart. We're",
      "full year. Now before that, now as that year came to end they have $15,000 total in zakah but they also have a short-term loan of $5,000 so now we would say you'd have 15,000 minus 5,000 you owe zakah on 10,000, you owe 250 dollars right? Let's take another scenario here you had 75 thousand dollars so you have the nisab which you bought a home for half a million dollars and it had a twenty five hundred dollar monthly payment",
      "$25,000. And you have that $25 thousand dollars now your zakat is due right someone could if they wanted to say well my mortgage payment is coming up you could subtract it if he really really wanted to I don't think you should because you also have income coming in but let's just say you want it too so now you would say that short-term debt is only twenty five hundred dollars that's coming up so I pay zakat on the remainder of it right? The third example it's even more explicit so imagine somebody had this number is a little bit off as we can fix",
      "say someone was below the nisab and then one six months later they get above the nissab right. And so now they've hit the nissaab, they waited a whole year at the end of the year they have ten thousand dollars right but they have a student loan payment of twenty five hundred dollars due I may have a rent of fifteen hundred dollars do and they have short-term loan of three thousand to so that 10,000 you subtract all those short term loans and now they only own $3,000 actually don't even have the nisaab anymore. So despite the fact they have 10,00 in their account because",
      "they actually don't have to pay zakat, right? So yeah, that's how you would do it. You'd go through your spreadsheets, lay all this stuff out and then subtract your short-term liabilities. And if your short term liabilities are, you know, your zakat... If you meet the nisab after that, then you pay on the full amount, right.",
      "to go to like debtors anonymous? Yeah. Would you help them? Yeah, so that comes back to the issue of being prudent and wise and saying what is this person's issue? So for instance I had a case just like this where someone said that their father was horrible with money and would squander the money and they would have this is the real case their water and power would go out regularly because they wouldn't have money for it. So I'd say okay they're eligible for Zikr yes pay their water tell them I'll pay your water bill and electricity bill",
      "So that way you're just taking care of the specific debt and you're not actually facilitating some bad habit they may have, right? So you can again pay off the debt But you're doing it in a way That's going to ensure that it goes directly to the debtor rather than to the person who's then gonna not use it properly, right Yeah",
      "Because they can't pay the rent. Yeah, what do you do? So again it comes back to the issue is why are they in this predicament Is it because they're genuinely in need It's some sort of or is it just that they're bad with money and wasting money if they're wasting money Where it's like you actually have the money to pay the but you keep going and wasting on certain things You don't give them zakah But if they actually have for instance like temporary disabled right or some other factor That's making them chronically needs a cut that's actually okay If someone isn't chronically in need of zakah",
      "in need of zakah, in a legitimate circumstance where even government assistance everything else is not sufficient, the zakah could be used to make sure that they're able to survive. Now what you would suggest in that case is typically downsize and live the most reasonable lifestyle so this happens people have like a four-bedroom home I know they fall on hard times it's like we can't pay your rent on your four bedroom home indefinitely what's reasonable for you to live in right? You need a two-bed room apartment okay that's gonna cut our zakah in half essentially right so",
      "the holistic circumstances that they're in. There's a lot of ambiguity that goes into this so it's there's nothing, there's no exact science to this. A lot of it is being prudent and wise and not squandering money that you have. No but someone could be a chronic debtor but again the underlying thing",
      "So for instance, did someone fall under some economic hardship? No. They're just bad with money then. Then you don't give them zakah. Allahumma alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu."

      "Sorry again for the confusion, but we had to change it again. It's going to be in the conference hall. The Zakat seminar is not the conference",
      "Inside here, the prayer hall. Inside the main message. So the sisters are welcome to come inside and we'll have the brothers on the other side. We'll set up chairs right now.",
      "All right. We're going to go ahead and get started, inshallah. So I'm not going to do a lot of talking about this. I think you all know Dr. Uthman Amarji and Dr. Muzammal Siddiqui very well. So this is the Sagaat seminar. Inshallah we're going for an hour and a half probably till like 7 then we'll open the floor for Q&A. If you have any questions related to the subject that's being spoken at that moment, you can always raise your hand and inshAllah speaker will call on you and answer your question. And yeah pretty much it without further ado",
      "Without further ado, we'll start with Dr. Mazamul.",
      "الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله وعلى آله وصحبه ومن ولاه",
      "those who are humble in their prayers and those who avoid vain talks and when deeds and those Who are the actors and those? Who do the acts of zakat? So zakat is a third pillar of Islam and Unfortunately, it's the most neglected one lot of people pray and fast",
      "And fast. And go to Hajj again and again. And Umrah. But when it comes to Zakat, they don't pay much attention. Some people don't pray Zakat. And some people pay but they think whatever I can, I will give. They don't keep an account of it. They do not do it as it is supposed to be done. But if they feel like giving, give it.",
      "Just like somebody say I want to pray two rakah for Zohar So you pray two Rakha that will not be Zohr. That's not Zohor So zakat is to be done as we are told to be them That means this is a very restricted Duty very restricted charity so we have the word Sadaqa in Islam Sadaqu is charity",
      "and that you can give whatever you like whenever you like to whomsoever you want to give you can but as far as zakat is concerned the god is obligation on those who have certain amount and that amount reaches the nassab and the one year has passed over it",
      "this is the certain percentage has to be taken out and then to whom you should give it's not like anybody who would like to give but you to whom we should give so all these things are specified a specified funds a specified time a specified uh group of people to be to be given to them so it is important to learn that",
      "and one should not neglect it. Those who do not believe in Zakat, they are kafir, they're disbelievers. Abu Bakr, the first Khalifa when he found out that there were some people saying we pray, we fast but we will not give Zakat or we'll not give to Zakat as prescribed by Sharia",
      "We consider them as murtaddeen, those who have gone away from Islam. They rejected Islam and then after that so he sent an army to fight them. So it was recognized and then from that time onwards always considered that it is an obligation. And those who consider this as an obligation but they don't do it, they are sinners",
      "they are sinners. They are committing haram and the money that they have, that money itself can become haram. And Abdullah ibn Masud used to say, You are commanded to do the salat and zakat together. There are 30 places in the Quran where salat",
      "you are told to do both so if those who do not pay zakat in Salah is not acceptable it's very strong command and Allah SWT has told us to do that and the Rasulullah SAW warned those who don't give Zakat their money will become like something that is going to go around like a snake",
      "snake going around their neck. A very poisonous snake that will be going around the neck on the day of judgment and Allah save us from that. It is very important to know the details and our brother Dr Usman Umarji has a full program, Mashallah I have seen that he's been doing that for the last few years Mashallah so I asked him to present this excellent program",
      "and show you what the Zakat Salat means, and what kind of wealth on which Zakat is, and how much, and to whom it should be given. BarakAllahu khair. Here you can have it.",
      "We begin the name of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. We ask Allah to accept from all of us during these blessed days We ask a lot who allow us to maximize their Ibadah during these last few sacred nights of Ramadan Allah, I mean so inshallah as Dr. Muzamma mentioned this sacred act of worship one of the huge pillars of our faith is something people know very little about and Inshallah over the next hour and a half we'll try to cover both the spirit and the objectives of zakat and kind of historically how we think about it And then we'll also speak about the nuts in the bolts",
      "bolts we'll get into all the details and the juicy things you're probably wanting to ask about including your retirement accounts, your business so on and so forth. So I will begin by speaking first about the meanings, the objectives and the spirit of zakah and that will be for about maybe 25-30 minutes then we'll move into the technical part of it afterwards. If you have questions you may ask them at any time but please make sure they're relevant to what we're speaking about because most of the time you're getting ahead of yourself and we will address those questions inshallah.",
      "It literally means to grow or to increase or to become more purified or to be cleansed and so Allah has chosen this word that even at the most basic linguistic meaning, has these noble kind of meanings behind it. That through the payment of zakah our wealth becomes pure, right? Our hearts become clean, right, our wealth and our Iman they grow and Allah says in the Quran",
      "Wallahu simon alim. Inshallah we'll get the presentation up and ready but in the meantime it's not urgent right now because there's no numbers on the screen Allah says in surah at-tawbah he's commanding the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to take from their wealth a charity by which you purify and you increase them and invoke Allah's blessings upon them indeed your dua are a source of reassurance for them and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is all hearing and all knowing Now interestingly, there's another word the Quran uses to speak about growth",
      "It's actually in reality exact opposite and that's words riba where allows to the word ribba and the word zakat Linguistically both mean to grow But only one of them has true growth in that sense, which is the act of zakah whereas Allah says yamhaq allahu riba well your besada caught so a lot destroys Rib out what you think there was growth in any causes increase in zakah Which people often think there's a decrease in because my money is disappearing And this is why the Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam he wanted to assure our hearts because he knows if human beings",
      "he knows a human being is predisposed to loving money. There's almost no topic that it as difficult to convince Muslims of rather than to pay their zakah properly because of the love for wealth, that you love wealth with this abundance of love and so it's incredibly important for us to understand number one soften our hearts and understanding the perspective of the Quran and the promise of Allah and the",
      "So Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala says in the Quran, He said, That part of our transaction with Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la, Part of our deal of La ilahaillallah Muhammad Rasulullah, Being believers is that Allah has purchased from us Our life and our wealth. So many people they're okay With some aspects of their life. Okay I'll get up at 5 in the morning right? I'll have suhoor, I won't eat right?",
      "of these bodily acts i'll pray even but don't touch my money right that is a very common way that many people live which is why the prophet muhammad said he said that charity and charity in early language of the prophet mohammed and the quran sadaka it's confusing it means as well at times so in the qur'an when allah uses the word sometimes",
      "So here the Prophet is saying is that charity is a proof. It's a proof of your iman Which is why again if you're not willing to put your money where your mouth is If you're putting to put Your Money right on the line here then one truly is not a believer which is why a booker fought them with law and for the prophet muhammad salam, right had declared there's no Islam for the one who doesn't pay their zakat so And then the Prophet gave us a beautiful words that should satisfy our hearts exactly",
      "satisfy our hearts in case there's any worry about our money. He said, wealth does not decrease with charity so give in charity and here again is a test for the believers do you believe in the words of the Prophet Muhammad when he's telling you if you give this charity your wealth will not decrease so given charity If one believes a messenger of Allah then it becomes easy to give and if one does not believe in",
      "their zakah they have issues of their iman as well and so we move to understanding now technically or legally what does this mean yes it means to grow it means be purified and clean but from a fiqhi perspective the word zaka amongst all the definitions that i like is the determined share of wealth prescribed by allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to be distributed amongst deserving categories and just like dr muzamil mentioned so we're talking about a technical calculation of your wealth",
      "your wealth that is to be given in a very particular way to a very particularly group of people so that is the difference between zakah and sadaqa right so we will speak about three things in our talk we'll speak about what is the capital then so there are assets that are liable to zaka we'll talk about their conditions for that wealth to be paid upon and we'll talked about the people who are deserving of it amongst",
      "Charity and elevate it into something which is a pillar of one's faith by which Islam itself cannot stand It is because and it's a purely financial I betta you write a check And by writing a check, you fulfill a major aspect of your faith Zakia has the ability to transform society Amongst its ambitions. It is the primary welfare system of Islam so, of course in our Western Society for the most part that Taxes are taken and tax days coming up in a few days",
      "in a few days i did my taxes this weekend and everyone gets that shock when you realize how much do you pay in taxes and a lot of those taxes are given to the poor through different mechanisms now in islam we have a different mechanism for that which is predominantly zakat so it's the first and foremost welfare system of islam and then of course we have al-qaaf and we have endowments and then we have voluntary contributions but zakaah is the first",
      "infrastructure of an islamic economy people often don't reflect over the fact that even during covid some of you got stimulus payments why was a government handing you free money anyone know is it because i love you right no it is because they realize that people when you give them money are going to spend that money and they want to use that because they want",
      "like they're strapped for cash and they decide to start saving that money and putting it into their bank and not spending it well then that's bad for the businesses, it's bad of the economy of society. So when you give money to those who are in need Zakah actually facilitates the growth of an economy because those who have surplus will sit on their bank account but when you transfer that to the poor, the poor use it because they'll use it for rent and groceries and kids education and all other fundamental needs of life so it helps an economy grow",
      "It also is predominantly for poverty alleviation as we'll see in some coming examples it is the first and foremost mechanism of alleviating the distress of those in poverty. In today's world even in the United States about 20% of youth are in poverty, about 13 percent of the population lives in poverty and in the Muslim world those numbers are sometimes as high as 68 percent of a society living in poverty And then we have to sometimes ask ourselves and people often look and say well why are Muslims not ahead? Why is Islam",
      "Why is Islam not thriving in the world? And Muslims, we say, well really it's not complicated. We don't practice Islam. So if we only cherry pick and say okay, we'll do Salah and we'll to Tawraweeh right and we will do Jummah, but we will not have Islamic economics and finance and zakat being implemented then don't be surprised when we don't see the fruits of Islam right in our lives. And then the last thing I wanted to mention is that it's actually spiritually very important behavior because it creates harmony between two often opposing sides of society. In almost any society",
      "any society what typically happens especially in a capitalist society is the wealthy look down on the poor as uh you know like sucking you know the resources from from from society and the poor despise the wealthy because they look at them as oppressive and doing everything they can to suck all the money out of their pockets and that's the reality of society we see that money continuously transfers in our governments typically from those who are poor towards those who",
      "So what zakat does, as many scholars have written about, is it creates harmony actually between the rich and the poor. Because now the poor who are the have-nots when they're getting it from the haves imagine in your own community you have poor people all around you we do here in Garden Grove or even the neighboring communities in Santa Ana and you see Muslims go and give wealth to those communities What are those poor people going to say when they are recipients of Zakat?",
      "Subhanahu wa ta'ala for that wealth and then they're gonna thank Allah and praise those who've given them that well Allah bless their wealth Because we're getting some of that wealth a lot increased them in their wealth because there'll be the recipients of that as well So it creates harmony between right these two groups of people so Omar bin Khattab was narrated to have said and some attributed to the Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam this idea behind",
      "because people often think that well islam is not about us investing our wealth it just wants us to give charity actually in islam there's a major incentive to invest which i know a lot of us are investing and a lot paid on those investments was said he said he says invest the wealth of the orphans so okay so that it is not consumed by zakat",
      "then that money sits around in an account it is not circulating around society benefiting and growing in other ways both for us as well as for the businesses that are out there and then we have to pay a zakat on it now it literally will decrease of course spiritually there's other things but just to give you an example if you had your hundred thousand dollars of money in your bank account today and you said i'm going to leave it",
      "$2500 in Zika and now you have ninety seven thousand five hundred and then that year passes and you spend two and a half percent after Five years, you are down to eighty six thousand dollars about or by the sixth year So you've lost a good chunk of your wealth by not investing it. So Islam is encouraging us actually to invest our money because That will make our money grow And we know that for almost any good investment a good investment is more than two and half percent",
      "at higher rates and then you're going to continue to pay a small percentage of that. So both sides win, you win when you invest and then the society wins when you can invest and of course those who are needy they also benefit right when you Invest so this is an incentive for all of us to think hard about putting our money in the right places This is not a talk to say don't care about money at all and be detached from this dunya and be a Zahid And just take all your money and give it away No work hard invest your money Enjoy that money the way Allah has allowed you to",
      "fill the rights of deserving parties. Just to give you some ideas about how our society is going in the opposite direction that it should, just in the last 20 years we see those who were in the top 10% of wealth have continued to take a larger share and those in the bottom 90% are now – just to give",
      "by those in the bottom 90th percentile. By 2016, they now have less than a quarter, closer to about 20%. So you can see that systematically when you don't have a method of transferring money from the rich to the poor. In any society, you're going to find the rich are going to get richer and the poor are going",
      "of allah and do not cause yourself destruction at your own hands what this means is by not giving when you withhold your money and you don't give it to the deserving parties you're causing your own destruction in this regard so we need to make sure that our hearts understand our obligation right to those who have a right over us there's a famous story i'll mention about um but really i mean pulls my you know every time i hear it you know shakes your heart how he understood the the burden on the shoulders",
      "as the kharifa and he's walking on the outskirts of the city of medina and he sees a poor woman with her kids and she's boiling uh a pot of water with some stones inside of it and he goes and he and he says these kids are like screaming and crying so he asked the lady that what's wrong she said that i have nothing to feed my kids and they're crying out of hunger so i'm boiling this water with with stones in it they think that food is cooking and perhaps i'm hoping that by the time this water boils off",
      "And then she said to him, and she didn't know who he was. It's just a man walking down the street to her. And she said, and I complained to Allah about the Khalifa Umar ibn Khattab. And so Umar was like, why are you complaining about Umar? And she says that it is the job of the ruler of a people to make sure the needs of the people are being met because people have dignity and pride. They're not going to go and beg. And So he told her okay, I'll come back with something for you Don't let your kids fall asleep",
      "during this incident. So he runs back, he gathers a huge sack of flour and some butter. He gives the butter jar to Abbas. He carries a huge sac of flour, and he's walking for a long distance. And imagine carrying a huge stack of flour you get from Costco right on your shoulders. And Abbas is telling him as he sees the flour on his beard, on his shirt, on her hair that...and he sees Omar struggling to carry it, that can I carry this for you? And he says, Abbas, you cannot carry my burdens on the Day of Judgment.",
      "He goes to that woman. He makes a fire. He cooks her a meal. He spoon feeds the kids and then he tells her that I am related to Omar al-Khattab. He didn't say his name is Omar, and come tomorrow and Omar will make sure he takes care of your needs. And he walks back and he tells Abbas, he said, I felt the weight of the mountains on my shoulders until I saw those kids smile and their stomachs being full. The next day when the woman came, he begged her for forgiveness",
      "cut her a stipend from zakah that she could use in perpetuity for her kids. But really, the moral of this story is that every single one of us, even if we're not the khalifa, even",
      "begging us for money. It is our job to seek them out and make sure that their needs are being met. And just to give us some hope, sobering hope because the reality is very far from where we should be there have been studies that have been done because I just mentioned these really sad statistics that about 50 some Muslim countries you have half of the country in poverty and in some countries up to about 68 percent. You'd say how could",
      "some people, even from this community, Dr. Mundur Qahaf, who many of you know and other economists have done large studies that looked at how much money has to go from the rich to the poor to get rid of poverty in a society. And in their studies what they find is that you need about 4% of a GDP of a country. Their gross domestic product, all their rents, right? All their products that they get. If that wealth transfers to the needy then you should be able to get",
      "percent is needed well how much can zakat generate in any country and country by country they went through these countries pakistan malaysia other countries they found that somewhere between three and about seven and a half percent of gdp transfer occurs if every muslim in the country or all the muslims in the so you'd say okay worst case scenario we get rid of about 75 of poverty best case scenario there's absolutely no",
      "Even with the lack of Islamic governance all over the place, it could still eliminate poverty in our countries. Yet when you look to actually what is happening today in most Muslim countries, the percentage of GDP that's transferring to the poor is less than a third of a percent in every country. So we said you need about – you can generate about 3.5% to 7%. What is actually going is less then a third or a percent and in some places it's about a 20th of a",
      "of a percent. So like in Egypt it was about a 20th of a % and Jordan is about 20% Pakistan which was the best at 0.3% was being transferred over so clearly something is wrong with the Muslim world in terms of how we think about this as Dr. Muzammal mentioned most people even here constantly we deal with it where you give a khutbah or you give reminder about zakah and people come who are million I've given a seminar before to millionaires just",
      "idea that I had to actually do something systematic, I just go to like a fundraiser in the community and I write a check for a few thousand dollars. And I thought that's my zikr. So they're worth millions of dollars. They wrote like a $5,000 check and think about the Delta between what they truly owed and what they've paid. Now they are worried and these are good righteous people. These are not bad people but it was the ignorance that they had never been taught that we have such a difference between what we should be and where we could be and actually where",
      "actually where we're at. In Islamic history, we have phenomenal examples of how when Muslims implemented the Sharia properly and the Zakat system properly, what happened? The most famous story we have is from the life of Mu'adh ibn Jabal al-Radi al-Huwan when he was sent by the Prophet Muhammad as the wali, as a governor of Yemen. In his short stint of a few decades in Yemen,",
      "Zakah assets, the second year half of the Zakah Assets and in the third year all of the zikah assets. In other words in that short period of time in The first year that he sent money back He needed two-thirds of the zakat to eliminate poverty now a third was extra in the second Year he needed half of this Zakat and the third Year zero meaning everyone paid Zakah And there is no one to receive it so he sent all of his Zakah from Yemen Back to Medina which goes against what we typically do an Omar didn't like this he's like I didn't send you as a tax collector",
      "I didn't send you as a tax collector, but he's like there's no one poor here So give it to those who are needy in other places in the ummah The second example came about 100 years or about 75 years later during the reign of Omar ibn Abdulaziz the great-great grandson of Omar bin Khattab In Egypt during his reign the same thing happened where the governor's wrote back saying that we have no one who's collecting the zakat so what do we do with the zakah when there's No one to take it and that's when he said that well You know what buy slaves and free them with the zaka",
      "free them with the zakah he said build rest areas on the highways and even go up and down the streets yelling to people are there any young people who want to get married so we can use this like a to pay for their wedding many people want to marry you know today and they're like I don't have enough money yet right for the mahar right for",
      "of the opposite. In the Middle East, the average age of marriage has skyrocketed predominantly because of the inability for young men to provide and that of course is a moral disease it creates. So zakah can create so many solutions beyond simple financially. It actually reforms entire society. In conclusion in this first portion of the talk, for us to recognize that zakah is beneficial to the one who pays and the one",
      "purifies that wealth, it provides barakah in that wealth. A dollar that has gone through the zakah process is worth more. When you have made your wealth, you said I've got money and I'm going to pay zakah on it. Now that money has barakah In it. It will go farther. And many people complain about this. SubhanAllah You see it today. There's people who make so much money and they say I have nothing to show for it. I am I make 100000, I make $200,000 but I just feel like I'm living check to check. And actually the recent even numbers",
      "I think 50% of those who make like a hundred two hundred thousand dollars are living check to check How do you make that much money? That puts you in the top quartile of society that you're still living check-to-check There's no but okay and that money it is not being distributed the way. It's supposed to be distributed It's not being spent though. It supposed to right Allah has stripped it right of its ability to To do so much, so think about every meal that you eat how much it can nourish Think about your car when you drive think about how much further it can go",
      "how much further it can go. Think about every dollar you spend when there is sadaqah and zakah that it's gone through, then realize that that is going to go much farther in your life. And that's not just in the money but then of course in your children's lives, right? In your own health, right?In all different things of life that you cannot even begin to fathom, you will see that barakah insha'Allah. It is a means of forgiveness for the one who pays. It",
      "We by our design, right? We had this love for wealth and we don't want to give it up Yet when you go and you are in communities And you see the need that people have and you give it to them That actually purifies your own heart and you recognize you feel better about it They call this a warm glow effect Right in psychology research that those who give are happier than those who don't give even non-muslims Because they recognize that there's you're bringing khair into somebody's life You realize that you're the upper hand and realize you can do good for somebody",
      "somebody and that benefits you in your own life and it propels you to do more, to volunteer more and to give more. It inculcates gratitude right the one who gives now is appreciative to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that you're in that position to give and it increases our risk ultimately right for society it alleviates the burden right and the stress on the elderly right in an ideal situation if you had people who are old they could be cut a check from zakah",
      "of social security right it helps the orphans right and then the needy it creates jobs it eliminates debt right it protects the this the country itself from crime right it creates growth it creates harmony so at a macro level has tremendous benefits as well and as Dr. Muzamma mentioned there are tremendous reward for paying zakah and great punishments for not paying it uh the prophet said that when he came to zakah",
      "date from halal earnings and allah only accepts that which is good then allah will accept that and increase it in size for the giver just like one of you might rear a full until it is the size of a mountain again just to visualize i imagine a baby horse how big is a babyhorse imagine it growing to the sizeofa mountain think about your dollar that you give think about how many times it has increasedand how large it would belike a mountain right of cash essentially whenyou stand before allah subhanahu wa ta'ala",
      "of the good that will be in it, Allah will reward you to that extent and give you growth in this life and the next. And then he said, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, he says whoever Allah has given wealth but he doesn't pay his zakah, his wealth will be turned into a venomous snake wrapped around his with two black dots over his eyes. That snake will wind around the neck and bite his jaws and say I am your wealth, I am my treasure. So that is what your money will tell you in the grave on the day of judgment if you withhold that from its deserving parties.",
      "So with that, inshallah, we'll move into the second part which is to get into the nuts and bolts. And the technical aspects of it. So inshAllah our PowerPoint will work at this point. What's up? Is it working? Hamza can you toggle it to another input? Okay.",
      "It's okay. We can continue until he has that ready and I can always email this later So inshallah we want and I'll stop now any questions kind of about the spirit or the objectives or the meanings of zaka And please dr. Will jump in and add anything, please It comes from the hadith",
      "And by the way, that is not for everything so we'll figure out the rate it changes depending on what asset We're speaking about. So now we're gonna get into all these technical aspects of it So now I understand what zakah is we understand why we give it we understand the reward for it and its potential",
      "let's talk about how do we do it as individuals oh yes it's a good question I don't know if I have like a big economic answer for it but just to contextualize this so his question has to do with the difference between in today's society we are taxed on the income that we make whereas an Islam were taxed",
      "and you spend $100,000 in the Islamic system. You have zero savings. You don't owe anything, right? Whereas here, you would owe your taxes, right, and then you don't have to give anything after your taxes. It's a good question. What seems to be apparent is that like Christians they tithe and their tithing as well is on their income which is 10% of their income so tithe is 1 tenth, right. So if they make $100k,",
      "ten thousand dollars per year they all they argue as well over pre-tax post taxes i also don't want to give at times but that's the liability that many christian denominations are that they have for in from the islamic perspective one of the things that's important is that number one is cash that is sitting around actually doesn't facilitate the type of growth that we need in a society right so when you have millions of dollars sitting around what do wealthy people do with it in this society there's only really one mechanism that you can use which is almost always going to be",
      "going to be interest-based mechanisms so if you have a billion dollars of cash the way that money grows is when it is given out in loans typically interest bearing loans for the most part credit cards and so forth and so it is typically this system promotes mechanisms of gaining cash that we would consider to be illicit right it doesn't have to be it just happens to be how it happens in in the modern capitalist system with",
      "your needs and your lifestyle give you no surplus then we don't ask you anything from that right if you have a surplus then that surplus needs to go to those who don't and that could be a much larger number if you haven't if you're about massive surplus so if you had a whole lot of money your wealth tax is gonna be much higher than income tax actually right and some people actually don't make a lot of annual income but they have a lot investments that make a lotta money and so again this is also a trick where many wealthy people their income taxes actually very low because most are well",
      "of their wealth is coming from investments and sometimes if they don't sell those investments so if you have stocks and you have things that have not been realized you could be making hundreds of you can make millions of dollars a year and have no tax liability right so i don't know if i answered your question but today's capitalist system makes sure that the wealthy pay the least and their effective tax rates are typically lower than the middle class that is well known right so the middle classes are typically squeezed the most and then the poor and the upper class are usually squeezed the least will go on",
      "Yes. I got it, we'll get into that question, I promise. We'll answer it soon, inshallah. So let's keep going for the sake of time because there's a lot here and you're gonna ask a lot of questions, I know without a doubt, right?",
      "a doubt right so we want to speak about now is okay so what do we pay zakat on what is exempt what is an assaab what is the howl who pays who do we paid you on all these things right so let's start from the very top so what is and i use the word in english right what is liable to paying zaka on there are certain assets amongst the fundamental conditions of wealth that is libel to zakah",
      "and you fully own that money, I want to talk about what fully owned means as we move forward. Then that is wealth that is typically considered liable to zakat on. So that can include cash, gold, silver, kind of accounts that you have that are accruing money. It can include agricultural produce that you're growing, you know, produce on fruits and vegetables. It could include livestock, right? Goats and sheep and buffalos that are growing in size and having children. It includes real estate that is growing in its value, a business",
      "and even jewelry. So all these things could be liable to zakah depending on the details we'll get into. So first, let's speak about some of the exceptions. So what do you not pay zakah on? So you do not have to pay zakat on anything that you personally use. So for instance if you have any basic needs of life your basic cars that you drive, your basic home or homes that you might live in, of course your clothing, your watch like you know all those even if they're nice high-end possessions right so I'd say okay my clothes are maybe worth thousands",
      "maybe worth thousands of dollars. My car might be worth my two, three cars $100,000. Like my home is worth a million dollars. None of these are liable to pay zakat on, right? Because there are things that you are using for your personal life. There's no intention for growth behind them. They're actually probably depreciating anyway. So that's just the general rule. Things that you personally use are not liable, right, for zakat. The other thing that comes up often, and this by the way, if you could have more than one home, so if you have your summer home and then you have",
      "you just generally live in they're for you to live in and they're not like airbnbs and not certain other types of business type of possessions uh same thing with cars you might have your weekend car that you like to drive right you know somebody has a nice i like my lamborghini on saturdays and sundays if you have it allah has blessed you with that you don't have to pay zakat on it right as long as you're driving that and that's something which you use and it's not like i'm trading buying and selling cars the third thing",
      "So if sisters have jewelry, according to some of the madahib, they don't have to pay on that. We'll get into that inshallah later on. But a point to make on this because some people like I mentioned They make a lot of money but they spend all their money on their cars, on their homes, on Their clothes, on there watches and at the end of the year they have nothing to show for it My mind is boggled. I speak to Alhamdulillah very well-to-do men. May Allah bless the wealth of these people Muslims in Orange County",
      "county who make 200 300 000 a year and say i don't qualify to pay zakah and when you ask them it's yes well i eat out three four times a week i always have a new car every few months my wife gets new furniture every few month right we paint our home every six months we change our kitchen every year it's like they live a lifestyle that is so extravagant that although they're technically excused from zaka",
      "of wealth that is blameworthy in Islam. And that has its own accountability before Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. So even if one is not technically liable to pay, they might be held accountable for their extravagance on the Day of Judgment. So be mindful. That's why Allah says in the Quran, The children of Adam, you can live a good life. Wear nice clothes, eat good food, drink things that you like, enjoy yourself.",
      "enjoy yourself but do not be excessive for allah right does not love those right who are excessive right in what they purchase right so let's get into the two major terms we have to understand as we get into learning how to pair zaka and this is the terms of the word nisab and the word haul so the nissab is the arabic word that refers to the threshold of what is considered to be what distinguishes",
      "then you have now become someone who has been considered by Islamic law to have a good amount of wealth. And the nisab as well is different for different assets. So it's not like this fixed number, we'll talk about it in a minute. The second thing, so in other words one has to own this nisb before they become liable to pay zakah and we say depends on the asset we're speaking about. Number two is the word hawl. Hawl is a word that refers to the lunar year which is important",
      "not the gregorian calendar or the solar year so in islamic law when we are paying our zakah we're calculating it based on the lunar calendar so it's ramadan to ramadan or shawwal it's not january 1st january first because that is a delta of about 10 days a year which over time right accumulates so we pay based on and we calculate it based",
      "Other assets, we don't consider the haul at all like agriculture will get into. This is important because I know sometimes people think it's two and a half percent for one lunar year and that is what it is. That is on some wealth. Probably for most of you, that's all you need to know but the reality is it goes beyond that. If one has farms, right? Many people do, right? They have in Central Valley, they have farms, they apricots growing and pistachios and almonds and all these things or they have farm where they have goats and sheep. There's a completely different way",
      "that we'll get into if that is your circumstance. So who pays zakah then? Who is the one liable to paying? Number one, Muslims are the ones who are liable according to the vast majority of the madhabs, right? That the kuffar are not mukhatab by the sharia here so they are not asked to pay zakah. They have other things they have to pay like they'll pay their jizya in an Islamic state if that's the case. So the Muslim is liable",
      "You have to number one be Muslim. Number two own that nisab When applicable hold it for the period of time of a haul and then we talk about your debt That you don't have more debt than you have assets which sometimes happens people have money saved But their debt liabilities are very high We'll talk about that And the last thing is that age is not a requirement according to the majority of them without him and The difference of opinion here comes from is zakat do is it something? Which is the right of or is it on the person or is It on the wealth",
      "is it on the wealth and the other mother have say it's a right of the wealth there's an obligation on the money that is being earned which is important because many people especially in today's age we're saving for our kids college right and even we want to put our kids assets and other types of accounts we want them to have uh investment accounts and so many people will do this let's see okay i have my money but i've got my four kids they've got their college funds they've",
      "My personal preference is that it should be paid on everything, especially even if you follow the Hanafi school. That doesn't mandate it on young children It needs to come not from like a sinister Nia which many people they want evade zakah So it's like well I have all this money in my account Let me put that money in kids account so now I've got I had a family one year came to me They said we need to apply for zakat and I'm shocked and they're very well-to-do I Said what happened was everything okay?",
      "say everything was okay hamdulillah but like you know like you we have put a lot of money into our kids like uh fund they had fifty thousand dollars in each kid's fund and so their hundred thousand dollars of savings went to zero and so now they were like we actually need zakat money right yes exactly in this case the guardian has to pay right on behalf of the child even if it's in their account and it's",
      "Yes. Yeah, the question is if someone is not of sound intellect, right? Someone who's disabled or something like that but they have wealth. If that wealth is there then the trustee of that individual has to pay on behalf of that person. Yes. So the question again was if somebody has a child or dependent that is not intellectually capable of doing it, right, someone has dementia, an aging parent or a child who has a disability",
      "disability but they have assets that belong to them then their life they have to pay it's just the person who is responsible for them would pay on their behalf",
      "And that again comes from the view that zakah is an obligation on the money. It purifies the wealth itself. So it's not about the age of the person and in today's world you have children, you know can have all kinds of ways of making money like You know even they have YouTube stars and all these things little kids play video games make all kinds Of money. They're all liable for paying their zakat",
      "Yes, they should. I mean of course there's all kinds of legal things here to work out but so the question again I'll repeat it was if a child or someone else has a lot of wealth and that money is liable for zakah well then it should be invested as well because it rolls that money could decrease right? Yes, so that Yeah, the guardian should be responsible in that case",
      "for investing that money and typically what happens is that even with young people who make money yeah they you know the parent will put them with a financial advisor or something like that to put their money into the right safe assets right so we'll continue so the first category we're going to speak about is what applies to the vast majority of you and we'll take the most time on this which is the first look at the ball asset is gold silver money or assets sitting in accounts i'm gonna lump all these together because",
      "coin or silver coins or cash that you have or money sitting in accounts all of that is going to be treated as the same so then a sob applies and the whole applies and there's a specific rate so then it sob for all this gold which is the original unit of wealth that was used as a prophet muhammad said right was going to b20 dinars that was what came out to at his time which was equal",
      "two carat gold it comes out to three ounces so anytime you want you just can go to the google and type in price of gold and will tell you the price right now in real time by the ounce and i checked a few hours ago and it was like 2000 and i think seven dollars and like 80 cents or something that per ounce was my dad forgot 2007. so multiply it by 3 to get 3 ounce and you get about 6 000 like 6021 to be exact",
      "that they owned, adding all their gold, adding other silver, adding older cash and in all their accounts. Then they have hit the nisab Islam now considers you to be a person who has wealth. Okay? Now, the howl starts so today imagine someone came to you and said here is money and that money you had crosses you over 6,000 maybe puts you at 7 8 9 10 doesn't matter as long as you have a minimum of six. Now you say well I'm not liable to pay zakat yet",
      "pay zakah yet, but I've hit the nisab. Now what happens is if one lunar year passes and if today is it 19th Ramadan? 18th? I can't remember. 18th right? So we're 18th of Ramadan. You say next year if one year passes, and I get now to the 17th of Ramadhan as well, one full year has passed, do I still have $6000 that I own? Now there's a difference of opinion, but let's make your life easy. It doesn't matter about all these fluctuations.",
      "all these fluctuations. So maybe you had $6,000 today, tomorrow it went to 10 and then the week later it went 24 and then it went 22. It just goes like this, right? Don't worry about it. Just look to see the day that I hit the nisab and the day my hawl ends do I still have the money? If that is the case then you are liable to paying the zakah. That is the easiest way to do it for the most part. Now of course for most people",
      "on the edge right typically have like above right they'll have twenty thousand thirty thousand and then it'll dip between but usually doesn't drop below than a sob right so as long as it is still there right then you pay if somebody is poor right and then you just get to that six thousand dollar amount and then",
      "hit that point and then a month later you drop to three thousand dollars, then some scholars say well you know what when you get back to six start your howl all over again right. That's another opinion that's fine completely as well right so again make our life easy you have $6000 minimum you have it a year later now you have to pay zakat and the rate is two-and-a-half percent on your gold silver cash or any assets so what does this refer to? Savings accounts checking accounts Venmo",
      "retirement accounts, 401ks, stocks and all kinds of other assets. So we'll unpack those in a minute now but that's what's in this umbrella to speak about okay? Stop for a minute any questions about the umbrella not the details of the accounts because I will speak about them for like 30 minutes right yes",
      "for a short time, then don't consider that. For several few months that you don't have that money, that means you can start again counting your whole, your air. But if it is just for 10 days, 5 days, stocks goes up and down so you can ignore that. Yes?",
      "We'll get into all that. You're getting ahead of yourself. Okay, so let's now... So it's easy. Everyone wants gold? Easy. Silver? Easy Cash? No problem I can take my Venmo, my PayPal, all these other... My cash in my pocket, I can put them on the table, I figure out that I have this amount of money, no problem",
      "But what about all these fancy accounts that exist in today's world? That have so many conditions and rules and pre-tax and post-taX and penalties and all these things. Let's go through some of these, and I'll speak about four briefly just to kind of simplify this. Are we good? Oh yes! Is it jewelry?",
      "Okay. But gold jewelry, not just like a bar of gold or like... People have bars of gold. You can buy bars of golden anytime you want and it'll stay in a place and it's your bar of Gold and you have access to it whenever you want it right? So that's a good investment, right? If you've been given jewelry we'll get to that in more detail later but there's two positions, right the Hanafi Madhab mandates you have to pay on it And we'll talk about how The other three madhhabs say you do not pay on if its personal jewelry that you're wearing",
      "slide we'll cover that in more detail i was talking about gold i meant like gold that like you invest in it's coins with boolean right or if you buy it like off the internet and it's stored somewhere for you so other types of things people own that are assets stocks and then speak about an ira account a 401k and a pension let's start with stocks so stocks are have different versions right",
      "public and you want to purchase shares of that company, right? So you have shares of this particular stock, right. This could be in a mutual fund where you buy into the mutual fund so you're not owning individual stocks but you have a portion of it depending on how the fund buys it. You could have RSUs that are called restricted stock units if you work for a company that gives you restricted stock unit. You can have ESPP employee stock purchase plans if you worked for a",
      "publicly traded company. Those are all different things, let's talk about each. So if you have the first two are easy. You have shares of a company, you have your own account TD Ameritrade, Robinhood any of these things out there and you own those shares. There is two ways one could think about them. One way to think about it is that you're an owner of this business because you own a portion of the business and some scholars say you treat yourself like",
      "you have to do a lot of fancy accounting to figure out what your liability is as the business owner. I personally don't hold this position because nobody thinks about themselves as a business owner when you buy shares, you think about yourself as simply owning a commodity right and this literally the stock market the word stock market functionally understands that you're buying and selling commodities so you could buy baseball cards, you could",
      "Like you could buy all these commodities. Stocks are functionally the same to most people. They say, I want to buy something that I hope it goes up in value and then I want sell it. So in this case, you treat it like you would treat any ordinary income. So if you have the stock and you've purchased it and you bought Apple or you bought Tesla or you about Amazon and it goes into your account whenever your due date is, whenever that howl has passed and now you're back to saying, You know what? This is where 17th of Ramadan well, what is my stock",
      "my stock what is the account worth today it's worth ten thousand dollars okay it's where 10,000 I pay on 10,00 or it's gone down I bought it at 5,000 and it's only worth 2,000 will you pay on 2,0 it doesn't matter if you you don't have to realize it by selling it right and yes there's a small fee for selling it about whatever it is $10 for some places there might be capital gains unless you've realized any taxes you",
      "You're not trying to use it. It is doing what you want it to be doing which is growing so pay on that full amount Mutual funds are the exact same thing With our s use it's a little bit different anyone have RSUs So we can is it worth talking about some okay? So restricted stock units is when your employer says We're gonna gift you stock as part of your salaries you get Your salary in dollars, and then we're going to give you on top of it. Let's say",
      "But over four years. So every year they give you 250 and usually it's every quarter They give you a portion of that so today I got a piece of paper from my employer That says we're gonna give you 1,000 RSUs over the next 4 years well that 1000 shares could be worth like Thousands hundreds of thousands dollars perhaps right? You're worth a whole lot of money. You don't own that yet So you don't pay anything on it. So I have it maybe today one year passes and I'm doing my zakat",
      "Oh 250 of those are as used are now in my account They have no transferred over from the employer to the employee. Now I own 250 now I only have to add 250 to my pool of assets 750 I still don't own it right same thing second year passes Well, now you on 500 third year you own 750 fourth year and now you own the full thousand So unless it's in your account and you have access to it to buy it or to sell it If you don't have access",
      "something which you're liable to pay on so that's for rsus yes uh sure yes we can cover options well people don't do options as much anymore okay still have options yeah yeah okay so let's do espp first then we'll do options espp employee stock purchase plan it's when your employer tells you you can buy the stock at a discounted price so this is the same thing you buying your stock and if their shares at a 15 percent discount which is a perk to you and as soon as you own them",
      "own them, right? That ends up becoming part of your account and you have to pay on the full value of it. So yes, you've only paid 50, you paid 85% of what it's actually worth, but you then owe on the And if you haven't yet met your strike date, that money has been accumulating in an account, you'll have to count that money in the account. So let's just say you've got $5,000 in the ESPP, but your strike data is after your Zaka is due, you'd say, well, I've got",
      "but it is still something which you have to count in your zika because you put money into that pool. It's just waiting for a certain date before you own the stock. Right now, it's cash. It'll become a share at the end of the day, but you still have to add it into your assets. Stock options are when... Is it question on the same topic? Yeah, crypto would be just like anything else, right? Like treated like cash. Whatever its equivalent worth is, you would just add that into your total assets.",
      "into your total assets. So if you have a Bitcoin, whatever that Bitcoin is worth, you add it to your total asset. The question had to do with cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum, all these things, you treat it like anything else. If it's got monetary value, whatever the market value is, that is what you add into your assets. Right? So stock options are when your employer tells you usually when you get hired but not always",
      "a right to buy these shares but not today you can buy them in a couple of years let's just say it's four years is often typical but at the date at the price of the stock today so you say today i joined amazon i don't know what amazon stock is worth let's say it says a thousand dollars they say okay today it's worth a thousand but i don' t own it yet they promised me i had the right to",
      "you have a right to buy it. You'd stop and say, hmm should I buy it or should I not buy it? If the stock has gone down and now this talk is worth $500 no one would ever buy it doesn't make any sense it's called being underwater because the stock is worth less than your being offered to buy so of course there's no zakat there's nothing you're not gonna buy it's a bad idea if the stock",
      "cash sitting around you still haven't purchased it right so in this case you're also not liable even though you have a right to buy it when you buy it and you execute that transaction now you own that stock you owe on incomes now an ordinary income and you add it to your assets so even though doubled your money right you're now liable to pay on the full amount as long as again whenever your yours your howl comes to an end good all right so some of the recommendations",
      "there's always some element of riba and some things that may not be totally clean. It's good to try and give a portion of that away in sadaqah, that's like to purify from the impurities of it. And that's different than your zakah, right? That's just a recommendation scholars often give. So we make sure our money is 100% pure, right. Let's move to the IRA accounts. So an IRA account, individual retirement account, is an account that somebody opens on their own behalf",
      "So you typically can give, I think it's $6,000 now by the IRS. You can put $6000 into this account and that can be pre-tax as well if it's a traditional IRA. And then it can grow, right? You've put it into the account. It might be growing over time. Again, the same idea. You own this money in full. You've putting it into an account. That account might have restrictions but you chose the restrictions because you liked the perks. It is doing what you want it to do which is growing for your retirement.",
      "full amount every single year without deducting any penalties or taxes because you have not realized any taxes or penalties when i get to the 401k i'll mix mishmash these together a little bit right 401k is very very similar the difference is that it's the employer who's offering you this retirement account and they're saying look we don't want to pay for your retirement because there used to be a time where employers used to pay free retirement in pension funds",
      "code for tax code 401 clause k that says the employer now will incentivize and the government will incentivise people to save money because people are bad at saving money so the government said if you save a certain amount of money then we will not charge you taxes on that money now and your employer may then contribute and match a certain number out so maybe the employer says we're gonna match two-and-a-half percent or five",
      "I'm not paying taxes. So I'm reducing my tax liability. I was in this 25% bracket Now I dropped to this like 15 percent bracket that is great My employer's adding in $5,000 a year ten thousand dollars here so that's even greater Hamdulillah by all means take advantage of it but You have chosen to put your money in an account with these rules and restrictions that you cannot pull it out until fifty nine and a half Unless certain conditions are met so two opinions that exist",
      "One is the opinion that I personally hold and many other ulama here in Southern California nationally, which is you pay on the full amount that is vested every single year without subtracting taxes and penalties unless you realize those taxes and Penalties. And I'll explain what that means in then in the next few minutes, right? And the fourth bucket is a pension Which is when your employer actually is taking money out of your paycheck But you cannot access it until a certain time then you do not pay Zakat",
      "pay Zika on that until you actually receive your pension. Then it gets added to your ordinary income because of the restrictions on that account, right? So let me go into the 401k a bit. Pension. So you don't have to pay on your pension until you get it. So if you're young and you're paying into your pension, right, you don' t have to p ay on that because you don''t have any access to that at all. It would be good if someone knows how much they are putting in to pay",
      "into my pension because that's money you're earmarking but because you have zero access to that at all right then you don't have to pay on that uh because it's growing of course right but there's no access whatsoever even with penalties any of these things so traditionally pensions are not liable to zika but if you know the amount you're putting in monthly then you could add that and that would be a good thing to do so 401k let's be i'm going to separate between what is like what's good for your finances",
      "Okay. Penalty, 10%. Penalety, yeah.",
      "Yes. Okay, so let's look Yeah, so two opinions like I said position number one You pay on full because you have chosen to put your money in an account with restrictions and with perks and With employer matching and it is growing the full amount every single year So if I had a hundred thousand dollars in my 401k today Well, what is it doing for me? Is it doing what I want it to do?",
      "employer might have put a whole lot in, it's been pre-taxed. It is growing every single year and I want to use it when I retire. I don't wanna use it right now. So position number one is you pay on the full amount. Position number two is that well even though it's $100,000 on paper if you were to access that money that 100,000 would actually not be 100,00. It would be what? $100 thousand dollars if you pulled it out immediately it would become first 90,000 because",
      "taxes you 10%. That's a penalty for early withdrawal. The second thing that happens is it gets added to your ordinary income, which means whatever tax bracket you're in, that is the percentage you would pay on that $90,000. It might be 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%. So assuming it was 40%, right? Now you're down to like $55,000 essentially,",
      "Don't think that makes sense because of what I mentioned to you number one is You did not want to pull the money out. You did you did not pull it out It's all hypothetical and you're making money every year on $100,000 So how are you paying Zacat on fifty five thousand when you actually are your money is a hundred thousand 110,000 or in 20,000 30,000 it continuously is growing so That's my position There's a second position that exists if one wants to follow that position They're allowed to amjad gives that position and many others. I don't know. What is your opinion?",
      "opinions if you want to share yours sometimes the difference of opinion I always say look Allah's gonna take care of your wealth if you do everything as well as you can right yes am just exactly yeah I don't know about the other kids not all councils some do yes yes",
      "Got it. I'm going to cover right now get you you're always ahead of me Okay, so let's quickly understand the difference between Roth and traditional accounts because they have majors like a differences Be an eye full disclaimer. I am NOT speaking as a financial advisor. I was speaking as he's a cat advisor Okay One might be good for your bottom line one might be in the dunya when I'd be good. You decide",
      "Traditional 401k or a traditional IRA is pre-tax, meaning that that income that you've earmarked into these accounts gets deducted from what the government will tax you on. So again, whatever bracket you're in, you reduce your liability which can make you pay less taxes.",
      "Now you drop in brackets. They say if you're in a very low bracket now, then put your money into a Roth account because you're going to pay a very high tax rate on it and then you'll never pay tax in the future. So just to understand the difference. So with the traditional 401k, this is very important because people talk about penalties and taxes. There's some stuff in here people don't understand. So the first thing is that it's pre-tax like I mentioned. Number two, you cannot pull it out before 59 1⁄2 without certain restrictions. And we'll talk about those.",
      "and we'll talk about those so what can you do imagine someone had money in their 401k and they're like well i need to pay my zika on and i don't have any cash well you don't need to actually take a penalty and you don t actually have to pay your taxes on that which you actually uh taxes you might have to play on what you can do no you don' t actually you can pull a loan from your 401k for up",
      "less than $2 million in their 401k, then if you have $2 millions and your zakat is 50 thousand on this right? Then you can take the full loan out. So you could literally go to yourself, go to your 401k say I'm giving myself a loan. And that loan is on interest by the way which doesn't mean anything. You're paying yourself interest which is not interest in Islam. It's only interest to the government because they want to discourage you from borrowing money. They say well you got to pay yourself back",
      "interest in order to discourage you from making that loan. You're like, man I can't make up that extra money so they want to discourge you. So that's okay it's halal to take a loan from your 401k to pay off your zakah and you will not incur a penalty and you're totally good to go. That's number one. Number two is that you don't know your tax liability. So today I have this 401k and it's growing and I haven't paid a penny of taxes. Well what tax am I going to pay on it?",
      "you retire. If you're 60 years old and you say, you know what? I want to buy myself my dream home. And I'm going to pull out my entire 401k that's $2 million and buy my dream if you pull out $2 billion, you're going to get taxed 40%. Okay. Because you're pulling out a lot of money. If",
      "and he might have a liability it's up to 40. It's unknown. So my recommendation from a zakah perspective, not a finance perspective is when you put your money in Roth accounts, you know you're never overpaying because you've already paid taxes to the government and you never pay tax in the future so what you pay in zakah is exactly what you owe in zakat and there's no ambiguity about overpay or under paying with the traditional you might overpay but inshallah that is rewarded by Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala",
      "That's a difference again between Roth and traditional. My encouragement is Roth for simplicity of Zaka, but if you're in the higher bracket now, you might choose the traditional for tax benefits. But just know that you'll end up paying likely more in Zaka. Most people are savvy when they retire, they roll things over, do all kinds of other things. So this whole thing of people saying 40% taxes, they're using the extreme scenario typically to get out of paying some Zaka so I discourage that",
      "To each their own. Questions now on this topic? Because I'm sure people have many. Yes? Okay. Jazakallah khair.",
      "Yep. Okay. Yeah, does that come with her? Yes, yes.",
      "Great question. I will answer that, it's coming up soon. So her question has to do with, again you have assets that you also have upcoming expenses like rent or car payments or college tuition or all these things that you owe and then you also potential taxes you have to pay so how do you... Again this goes down to you have all your assets we need to subtract liabilities and there is a procedure for that. So we'll cover that inshallah in the coming slides. Good question though. Okay now I want to actually address",
      "when you should deduct from your 401k if you follow the position that i articulated which is you pay on full if you'd follow the second opinion then this is not relevant for you because you're already deducting if you actually realize those penalties and taxes is when you deduct them from your worth what do i mean by that so imagine somebody had two million dollars plus in their 401k now they could not take out their zakat liabilities greater than even the loan",
      "They do not have other stocks or cash in a checking account to say, I can write a $50,000 check. Or even if you had less, like I have $100,000 but all my money is locked up in my 401k or my house. I have nothing liquid. So okay, let's take that scenario. Somebody had $100K. How much did they own there? It's a cap. Not hard, 2.5%. You owe $2,500. But I don't have the money. So what do I have to do? I have",
      "to pay it. But if I dip into my 401k and assuming, let's just leave the penalties out for a minute that leave the loan out for him in it is okay if I pulled out $2,500 well I'm gonna have to pay tax on it and a penalty on it how much? Well you're not pulling out $100,000 keep that in mind you're only pulling out what you need to pay your Zaka so let's say I said I'm going to pull up three thousand dollars because it's going to be penalized and taxed by pulled",
      "That's what I owed when I did my numbers. But if I pull $2,500, I'm going to have a penalty on it and it's going to go below. So let's just say I pull out $3,000. Well, what happens? The government says you took it out early, pay us 10%. So you owe the government now $300. Now you have $2千7百 dollars. Then the government said well you now took out $3000 that got put into your ordinary income. You pay every year 20% in your tax sets for your bracket so I need 20% tax on this.",
      "So now you said, okay, I had $100,000 I owed on. But now I've actually lost 300 plus 540. So I've lost $740. Now I owe 99,160. How much do you owe? $2,479. All that hard work and it was a $21 difference.",
      "Oh my god, the penalty, the taxes is so... Okay you paid $840 in taxes and penalties but the difference in your zakat was $21. So don't dip into your 401k unnecessarily. Just write a check save money on the side strategically plan that as my 401k grows may Allah increase all of you in your wealth I hope it's good when we have these problems It means that Allah is blessing us right? But plan for it You know what today I only have",
      "have ten thousand dollars in my 401k that's not a big deal i can have you know 250 on the side of my account but what happens when it gets larger and larger either i have to reduce my contributions or i have save in other ways maybe i got to cut back on my or i need to make sure i can sell off my stocks prepare yourself to be in a situation so you don't come and say i don't know what to do i'm stuck like i i don' t want to liquidate it and i don''t want to do all these things just prepare so you're all savvy enough to figure out how much you have to save",
      "dollars a month or 100 a week in order to make sure that my zakat can be paid outside of incurring any of these um costs or these other penalties so that's when you should deduct if you follow the first opinion only when you actually dip into it right questions about that yes",
      "Good question. So if you have not sold the shares, again it's in your account, you take the full value because that's what it's growing. The full value is growing every day. If you sold it and now you've realized taxes, capital gains taxes or any other taxes then those are to be deducted",
      "If the stock was worth $1,000 but after taxes it's now worth $800. Well, now you only pay on $800 to only deduct if you realize And again The reason is again because the full amount is growing when you don't sell them It's continued and is doing what you want it to do. It is growing in the ways that you are But it matches your intention essentially right? Okay, so let's move fast. I know we have to go as of time. So I'm recommending a Roth for simplicity for Zika. Yes",
      "Yes. It makes your Zakah calculations 100% accurate. You never worry about overpaying one bit. Not necessarily. So again, with Roth, you are paying... If you make a whole lot of money and you're in a high bracket, then the Roth,",
      "10% in taxes already up front. I never paid again, so my zakah that I paid on the $100,000 is exactly what it's supposed to be. With a traditional, 30 years later when you withdraw, you have no idea what percentage you will end up paying. So you might end up overpaying, you might not overpay, so it just removes any ambiguity, right? So again, you decide what you think is best for your finances as well as simplicity for your zakah, right. It's okay either way, yes.",
      "No, of course not no. No it's great right and you get budget for all that right so She says any harm in overpaying? No It is a tremendously good deed right and it's good sometimes like buffer Sometimes why people like calculate to the dollar then you forget Oh I forgot my Venmo account had $1,000 and I forgot about PayPal account or I forgot About this account or that again their little account just look So you have so this is important this is a bad everyone has to have a spreadsheet",
      "You have to have a spreadsheet and that spreadsheet will say every single account that you have on it. Just do it today. Go home and write down, I have a PayPal account, I've a Venmo account,Ii have a checking account, i have this TD Ameritrade account,i have this 401k account, whatever account just list them all out and then put the dollar amount that exists and then say ah okay I'm above this the nisab. Okay you know what? I haven't paid zakat before. Okay let me start now. If",
      "right away. But then follow this every single year so you don't have this ambiguity. I cannot remember, oh my god, I have this Charles Schwab account that I put for my daughter and I completely forgot about it. It's been sitting there for years. Or I forgot about this random account that haven't touched. It was like my retirement account from a university that I taught at 10 years ago. It just sits there and you forget. So you have to have everything delineated and you put the date on it because no one remembers in Nassau either. No one remembers the date that their zakat is due. I have to open my spreadsheet to realize that it's the...I forgot now. It looks like something in Shaban, right?",
      "done, right? That's the only way I remember. So if you don't document this stuff, you are responsible at the end of the day. Yes. Yeah, 7-ish and then there'll be questions for those who are willing to stay after. Well, you've already received it. So you've received it, it's just sitting in an account.",
      "it's just sitting in an account so you pay on it now either the opinion opinion either in full or with some deductions and when the future when you receive it when you withdraw from it you treat it again like you just you pay money the full amount because you own it right yes interest in what account there shouldn't be interest in just a 401k but is it",
      "Not necessarily. Unless there's an interest thing built into it. So you might have bonds in your 401k. People also need to look at their 401ks and see if it's halal in the first place. Now all 401ks are halal because there's a lot of things that are impermissible within them. So part of being a good Muslim is seeing, hey does this have the assets that a Muslim should be investing in? If they're investing in all kinds of haram companies, you might want to rethink that or if you end up doing it, you have to purify a lot",
      "to get rid of that, like you have to literally donate it and there's no ajit for that either. And so yeah just calculate it if you have interest, donate it off and like there's not sadqa there right? Find some random good cause and just get rid it. Try not to have it. You can make phone calls and get this stuff taken off your bank accounts. So you can call your bank and say I don't want interest on it",
      "little bit of work but you can do it so let's move fast for time and then we'll give that so number two really fast we're at jewelry now so very very quick two major positions on jewelry one again it's liable to nisab right this like goes into your regular assets if you are from the hanafi school of thought well let's let me slow down a bit let's talk about jewelry in general two types of jewelry there is jewelry that is considered to be zakatable by everybody and then some scholars say",
      "and you are selling jewelry, gold, silver rings anything of that sort. And you have merchandise, you have an inventory or you buy it because you're trying to buy it so it grows in value. So again, it's stored for financial purposes the goal is appreciation. And at the end of the day if the Nia, if the intention is to make money on it then you have to pay Zakat on it. Again, so I said oh there's this really nice ring on the market it's worth $5,000 now if I buy it",
      "few years i'd never want to wear it in fact i think it's ugly just going to sit into like in my safe deposit box that is the catholic because it is a growth asset at this point right now when there's no zakat due is for the three madhubs then the maliki's and the hamburgis if it's personal jewelry that a sister owns all right so sister has uh or a man owns but they can't have gold",
      "because they're personal possessions that are being worn and used, and no intention of selling. They're going to be family heirlooms perhaps. But the niya is not to make money. I liked it. I got it as a gift. I bought it for my wedding. There's no zakah due according to those three madhahib. The Hanafis say you still have to pay zakah on it. How would you do it? You have to weigh the weight of gold and you pay on the weight so whatever many ounces or grams it is, you add that and you would pay.",
      "You don't want to break off a piece of the gold and donate it, so ideally you have some cash on the side that you would pay on. That's the Hanafi position. So if you're Hanafi and you want to follow that madhab, by all means, pay on your jewelry. If you are not, you don't have to pay because there's no intention of growth whatsoever. Number three, business assets. So, if one has a business, again what is counted in your zakah? Is if you have any inventory in your warehouse or merchandise out on your floor.",
      "production if you have wood, metal. Any of those things their market value is what you calculate into your Zakatable assets and any cash sitting in your business account all that is liable to Zaka. What is not liable for Zaka is if you've got a chandelier or building even for the reason that the business is happening out of. You have any sort of other machinery and furniture rental items none of that is Zakat able",
      "Any debt that is never, like dead debt essentially. You have customers who've owed you money and who've never paid it off. That is not liable for Zika as well. So that's for business really fast. I'm going to skip real estate for the time right now. We can ask in the Q&A. Anyone here own livestock or farms? Okay. Then I'm not going to go into the details. Just if you're curious, if you owned 30 cows or buffaloes, you would have to donate one year old.",
      "sheeps or goats, you have to give one of those as well. And there's all kinds of rules about what they have to look like and their size and so on and so forth. For agricultural produce, just so we're clear, I want to share with you the differences of opinion or show you how it's different than money. Agricultural produce has a different nisab. It's no longer going to be $6,000 worth. It is 600 kilograms worth. So if you have a farm and that farm has 600 kilograms of oats and wheat and barley or apples or apricots or nuts or any of these things, that is an nisb. There's also no hawl",
      "also no howl. No one's going to say, let me hold on to my 600 kilograms of apples for a year. Unless they're cosmic crisp, they will die. They've been bred to last longer. So you cannot. You have to on the day of harvest. That's what Allah says in the Quran. He says, وآتُ حقه يوم حصاد it. Give its right on the date that it's due. So in a traditional Islamic society there would be collectors who would be going around doing these things but if you have that farm, when you harvest you weigh it. If it's 600 kilograms, you have to pay on it.",
      "on it. And what do you pay? It's not two and a half percent. If it is naturally irrigated, meaning you don't have any water systems, you're not paying water bills, you don' t have sprinkler systems, You pay 10% because you've gotten this stuff practically right for free. Of course there's some investment but you pay a higher rate if you're paying for irrigation then the rate is 5%. So again just to show you an example of the nisab is different and the hawl doesn't apply",
      "to who is eligible to receive zakah. This is obviously a touchy subject. Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says in Surat At-Tawbah, Allah outlines for us eight different groups who deserve zakahs. Allah says zakah is only for the poor, the needy, those employed to collect it,",
      "So let's go through these eight quickly so you understand. Because in America especially, this is where I go on my rant for those who know me, every single organization in America claims to be zakat eligible almost.",
      "say, give us your zakah. Your job is to be an informed Muslim and to give it where you think it should go not to say well someone said I can give it to them. Number one the clear hadith of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and the verse of the Quran is that zakah is predominantly for the poor as the prophet told Mu'adh ibn Jabal he said that tell them",
      "That it is a wealth to be taken from the rich and given to the poor. That is the default of what zakah is about. Now, of course there's other categories but we'll get into it. But all of them have at the core of it this underlying individual human need. So the poor, who is the poor? The poor is the one who has practically nothing. You could say the one whose maybe in like dire poverty. Like really below like a threshold of even basic needs being met.",
      "They're the most deserving of zakah. Number two, the needy. Someone who has maybe the basics of life. Okay, you know what? I have a home I can live in. I can afford my rent but I can't afford groceries. I don't have anything proper clothing. We're lacking in fundamental things so they're still needy number three is employees of Zakat collection and this historically was when the Muslim Ummah had a khilafah and there would be Zakat employees",
      "Because they're going to go to the farms and say, you've got sheep. And you've cows and you have buffaloes and fruits and all these things We will help you calculate collect and transport it It's a lot of work to do this if you have a farm When it came to individual money people would give their individual money No one is going into bank accounts and checking But the state administered this So those who collect The state collects the zakah From that collection would give salaries to those zakah collectors Now today this presents itself in an",
      "in a interesting way where imagine i was to tell you all you know what i just gave this wonderful talk for you all on zakah now you know how to give zakah you know me and dr mazamma we know lots of poor people so please give us your zakam money we will go and give it to the poor but we charge you 20 percent how would you guys feel you wouldn't like it right this is essentially what happens when relief organizations get put up",
      "your dollar is not getting to the poor in totality, a portion is getting there. So the recommendation is try your best to give your zakah to entities that promise 100% distribution and that means we need to give sadaqa to these organizations so their overhead can be covered by sadaquah. Those salaries and all the other expenses inshaAllah if we can cover them by sadeqah then they can give 100% of our money to the truly the needy. We don't want that we give a dollar and some cases 60% or 50% or 30%.",
      "or 30% actually reach the poor. So ideally, in this circumstance, when I volunteer to give zakah to somebody, I should not skim money off the top. So that's up to individuals to decide how they give. Try and look for 100% zakah organizations. Yes? Yes? We'll get into all that. Yes. I'm going to go very fast for time. If I don't cover it, then ask the question. Only if it's related to what we're speaking about.",
      "And for those who need to get home for iftar, by all means don't feel like you need to be here. If those are going to stay for maghrib then we can keep going for another 15 minutes. Yeah. Exactly. So let's go through all this. Are they serving the poor? Are they giving money to the poor? No. Are their giving money the needy? No Number 3. Are there employees of zakat collection administered by a state? No",
      "Number four, those whose hearts aren't inclined. This has been understood traditionally in a couple of ways. One, it was understood again by the government to take money like the Prophet Muhammad and the early generations where even they might give it politically to certain parties to prevent harm. Let's say there are parties out there who want to harm the Muslims we might give them from our Zakat assets to help the affairs of the Muslims prevent wars and other things. Or today some people use it for people who are close to converting to Islam but again",
      "to Islam, but again there's certain reasons why they don't want to convert and there's benefits like for instance someone might get cut off from their family so they'll have no financial assets. So these fears. So giving money again to people who are close to converting. So again whose hearts are meant to be softened or inclined. Typically done by the state, but it can be done today in some limited circumstances. Freeing slaves and captives. Yes of course. Jazakallah khair. Jazakhallah Dr. Mazamil. I will reward you. We'll see you tonight inshallah. Those freeing",
      "So freeing slaves and captives. So again, slaves, if they're to be bought and freed would be great. POWs, right? If there's prisoners of war that we need Zakat money to free them or political prisoners as well. Those all fall under slaves and captivates. Number five, those who are in debt. This refers to those people who are genuinely in debt you have people who generally were needed to begin with. They had to take a loan something went south. They were unable to pay back their loan now they're in debt they can't even pay back",
      "be used to pay back, right? Their debt in this case. This does not apply, well you know I bought a home, right Alhamdulillah, I got an $8000 a month mortgage with these 7% interest rates I need zakat to pay my mortgage off, right No no of course not, right. This is a genuine unable to payback people who are stuck and crippled in debt Now we get to your question sister which is the dicey question of the day always, which is fee sabidullah Which literally means, right, in the causes or the ways of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala",
      "understood historically in certain ways, and in modern ways some loosening to say the least. So Fisa Billah was understood at the time of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and the early generations to refer to jihad. Meaning it was used to fund military expeditions. Someone wants to go and fight and they need weapons, they need a horse, they access to things, they food to go on their journey into fight so the government would say here's money to go",
      "to fight. Then some scholars like the Hanbalis came along and said, well, Hajj is literally a path to Allah so we could use it for poor people who want to make Hajj as an example. Now today some fiqh councils have really opened this up and they kind of say, well fee sabi'illah means good causes so any good cause essentially we can pay zakat on and that's where all these organizations nationally come",
      "say give us your zakat money because we're eligible what do i do i'd do advocacy work i do uh you know political work right i do dawa right i'll do all these things and really the truth of the matter is that this is a gross in my opinion violation of the spirit of zakah because what it ends up doing it ends",
      "you give your money to like, and here's some rules. You are not supposed to be a beneficiary of your own zakah. So when you give money to a cause that you love, that you're benefiting from, that's not something which is supposed to give zakah to, right? So if I want to give my money to CARE because I love the work that CARE does. Well, if CARE is doing political advocacy and I like their political advocacy work and I'm a benefit of their political efficacy work or anything else, that'S NOT A ZAKAH ELIGIBLE ENTITY, RIGHT? In that case now, if they are serving the poor,",
      "same thing i love this dawah organization they do wonderful dhowa work i watch their lectures i read their you know you know the research right whatever it might be i attend their classes and then asking for zakat it's like you are benefiting from that this is a dawah organisation give them your sadaqah so please be mindful about who you give your zakatu to give it to these parties that allah has clearly delineated look let's make it easy if allah wanted zakat to be for any good cause he would have said in the masadaqatu fee sabi lala",
      "of good causes. Why did Allah make eight different categories when one category includes all of them? It kind of goes against the spirit of how Allah speaks in the Quran. It would be like having unnecessary words that have no meaning behind it, right? So for us to really say, no, feeza billah is a group and that is bounded in a certain way. Let's not violate, right, how that was understood just because non-prophets say, well, the Muslims don't want to give us let's just tap into their zikr pockets essentially,",
      "This is someone who might even have wealth, but they have no access to it. So let's just say that you're traveling another side of the world or someone is visiting America and perhaps they're wealthy. They lose their wallet. They loss their passport. They cannot access their accounts. They could actually collect Zakat in that case because they are a stranded traveler and Zakat would be an acceptable use for them. These are the eight categories. Don't give to people outside of these eight categories if you want to give to those outside groups",
      "to those outside groups, give them your sadaqah and they deserve your sidaqah. Please give to the dawah, advocacy all these other wonderful causes The masjid is not zakat eligible So you are not allowed to build your masjids with zakat You're not allowed benefit from the services that you're paying for so give them you're sadaquah Some other priorities, preferences sister your question. Number one, give it locally if there's a need This is the sunnah of the Prophet and all the madhahib Zakat should be given locally",
      "make your money locally, you live locally. Give it to the people who are poor in your communities. So the poor Muslims of Orange County have more right to your zakat than the poor Muslim's other parts of the world. That's the first rule. Number two, you can give some of your zakah to other places but let it be a smaller portion of it because give them your sadaqa. Palestine, Iraq, Pakistan, give them",
      "If your zakah was due on a certain date and you wanted to hold it for another date down the road, and for whatever reason that zakah got lost or destroyed or the stock market went down, you owe them out. That was due. Siblings are eligible. Your children and your parents or your grandparents are not eligible. People pretty much in your direct lineage. Anyone horizontal? Brothers and sisters, siblings, like you're not responsible for them. You can pay them your zakat.",
      "Has to be Muslim. Yes, has to be muslim right? Yeah. Okay other considerations I know we're getting close what time is the other Oh 730 now okay You don't have to tell people if you're giving them that that money is zikr What it? That's a comma oh Yeah, 730 that time is it common time right yeah 20 yeah, okay well wrap it up at 15 so we can put the chairs away",
      "the person that money is from zaka because people have dignity and honor and many people if you go and say you know i love you i know you're broke here's some money right that doesn't feel good right and so you can simply give them a gift in any way and they don't have to know what zakat at all right in any ways that you can get them that money it's fine number two it can be given incrementally if necessary if you know somebody is not good with money or they have a certain need this person i know cannot pay their rent for the next few months right i know",
      "in every month and I'll pay that. So, I've earmarked it but I'm paying it off over time. And that's in the case that if you worry that if gave somebody right now $5,000 of zakat they're just going to end up using it in ways that are not optimal then you don't do that. Number three, the person who has been given the zakat must own and control that zakat as well. So of course, if they ask you to pay their rent that's totally fine but it's not like what strings attach. The person is the owner of zakah. It's not the institution which is why",
      "money typically to institutions unless those people are giving it unless intuition is giving it two people right doesn't go for bricks and four other types of facilities right yes sister we've said about to them of course yeah so that I can go to anybody anytime any case non-muslims totally fine yes so and then do not give zakat able-bodied people who don't want to work this also happens much more than you imagine",
      "I got laid off. I'm worth $150,000 on the market. I keep turning them down. You go bag groceries and do whatever you need to do. When you put your full effort, we'll help you take care of it. We don't want to incentivize people to be like that. A couple things. It's nice to share but I've run numbers over the years",
      "project how much zakat we could actually generate in Orange County and I can show you the slide later, email it to you all. Based on some projections I have made, we easily can generate so if you had 250 people who had $100,000 of zakat money they would make, then they would generate 625,000 in zakat. If you had a couple millionaires, if you 100 millionaires just out of 1 million dollars they would",
      "we have because when i've given presentations people in the room said the people in this room make more money than what you're putting on your slide okay so here i've calculated at least about 25 million dollars of zakat in orange county do you think there'd be one poor muslim if we had 25 million coming into zakah there wouldn't be a poor muslin anywhere around us right so even locally forget globally and nationally like just think about what you could do in your community we could eradicate poverty of muslims in our locality if we were strategic and did these things properly",
      "these things properly um so i'm gonna that's part two i'm going to end i'm I'm going quickly have three minutes for my last portion this is like normally two hours this is condensed actually it's two and a half hours so it's just like this is a very fast version okay last few things now you said okay it's a lot of information let's get down to the nuts and bolts so how do you calculate your zika you have calculate all yours accountable assets my money my cash my 401k my business my agriculture whatever whatever it is right who cares",
      "from the loans that I have taken out in life. But let's figure out what type of loans. There's two types of loans, there is what we call short-term debt which is typically debt that's less than a year. So short term debt is like if I went to a brother and said hey can I borrow some money? I'll pay you back within this year. If that is the case, I could subtract all of that money because it's due in the same year just like my zakat is due in that year right. Long term debt are things",
      "So my mortgage is over 30 years or 15 years, or my rent is in perpetuity. It's just going to go on and on and On my car payments are over 60 months or 72 months My student loans are over you know five years These are all long-term things in that circumstance you subtract your upcoming installment only if that is like pending like very soon it's Like oh I got my zakat do but guess what next week? I've been living I've Been using all my electricity. I've already used it",
      "car payment for some of these things. The scholars say you are allowed to subtract one month or one installment essentially if, if you want to. My general opinion is just whatever is due that day, just deal with whatever you have that day. Sometimes it ends up being you paid rent yesterday, right? And so now you've already deducted that rent, right, or your bills like this whole forecasting, like just really doesn't people think it's a lot of money. It's not a lot. So your rent,",
      "A couple thousand dollars. What is two and a half percent of that couple thousand? Talking about 50 bucks maybe, right? 75 bucks maybe. So these type of little subtractions you could do but they don't make a big impact on your Zakat anyway but you're allowed to. Rules regarding debts that are owed to you. Someone owes you money. The general rule is that if so when the likelihood of receiving that money is high like someone says I'm going to pay you back this year",
      "And you're like, look I know he's gonna pay me back this year or even he says to you Like I got the money next time. I see you. I'll give it to you right? Yeah I know I'm gonna get that money and I'm behaving in life like I have that money Then you can add that into your Zakatable assets because it's like you functionally habit if You do not have it or you don't expect it back Or you cannot claim it anytime soon then you do not add that tears of capital assets So we give someone a loan you say pay me when you can pay it back and the person cannot pay it Back or its due but they're unable to pay it. They say I need another like six months",
      "Or it's again just dead debt, right? Someone owed you and they're insolvent in this case. If you end up getting money in the future, you add it to your future assets. We don't have to back pay on that, right. Okay, so let me quickly go through some scenarios and we're going to end with this. I know we're at our time. So imagine somebody had $25,000. Let's say the first of Ramadan, right, and you say okay, they have got the nisab. Well now we say well what happened throughout the end of the year? This person bought a car",
      "This person bought a car for $22,000. Well now they only have $3,000 but we say look don't worry. Don't start from scratch just wait until the end of the year. So let's say by the first of Ramadan again of the next year they were down to 3,000 in the middle of the Year, but by the end Of the year there back to 15 thousand dollars. It's okay. I'm the law They have been a sob the how it is passed. They still have it But let's check their debts and it turns out they have a debt of five thousand dollars or somebody its short term",
      "part of that car that they purchased or something like that, or home repairs $5,000 loan. So they owed $15,000 in zakat but they have a debt of $5000 and can subtract that now they owe zakao $10,000 so they only owe $250. It's very simple right? Scenario number two imagine somebody had in this case they had $75,000 dollars so of course they're at the nisab but in the middle of the year they bought a home for half a million dollars no there is no half-million dollar houses anymore one million dollar house right",
      "monthly payment, let's say whatever it is. Like let's see mortgage is the old slide so the numbers should be updated $2,500 a month, let us say their mortgage doesn't exist right? So they put a down payment of 50 grand. So you bought a home, you had 75 grand, you put 50,000 down now you have $25,000 right? First Ramadan comes like okay I've $25 thousand but my rent is due next week. Okay fine, you can subtract your $2 500 which puts you at 22,500 2 1⁄2%, 562 dollars and 50 cents",
      "50 cents. Not too complicated, right? Got it. Last example and we're done. Somebody had $3,000 in the first of Ramadan. No Nisab. I don't start calculating. Nothing happens. Six months later someone gives me $3.000. Now I have $6,000. Okay now I start calculating from the middle of the year. Let's say it's the 15th of Muharram. Now",
      "I owe $2,500 in my student loans. And I owe rent next week, $1,500. Wait, I also had a short-term loan for someone for a few thousand dollars. 10,000 minus 2,500 minus 2K versus that. Oh, I only have $3,000 in true assets at the end of the day. So he doesn't actually have the nisab. He doesn't pay any zakat in this circumstance. But this is where you have to sit down and do your accounting. Have your spreadsheets. These are my assets. These",
      "Calculate all of it out. Figure out your day every year and have your alarm on your phone, calculate your zakah, pay your zakat. Inshallah you're good to go. We ask Allah subhanAllah makes amongst those who pay our zakat and we ask Allah to make it a means of rewards for us. We asked Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la to allow us to serve those were in need, uh, to have love for those who are in need. And we ask God to put baraka in our wealth. SubhanAllah rabbika rabbalaizzati ya'ma yasifoon wa salamun alal mursaleen walhamdulillahi rabbil Alameen Jazamaulakhi khair for your patience I know we went a little bit over. Uh inshaAllah",
      "pray in that in a minute. I'll break your fast and we'll talk soon inshallah. Assalamualaikum. Yes, here's what I need. I need emails.",
